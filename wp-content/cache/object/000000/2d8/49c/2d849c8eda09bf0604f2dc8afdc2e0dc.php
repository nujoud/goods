<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods Framework, <a href="https://pods.io/2020/01/02/pods-needs-your-help-in-2020/">announced the project was seeking new donors</a> on Thursday.  Automattic, the primary sponsor, dropped out after funding the project since 2012.  This has put the team in a position to seek help for maintaining and supporting the project.  Automattic was previously covering around 90% of the costs.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods Framework</a> is a WordPress plugin that allows end-users or developers to create and extend custom post types, content types, users, media, and comments.  Essentially, it is a complete content management framework for those who need more than the basics that WordPress offers.  It has well over a dozen <a href="https://pods.io/plugins/">add-on plugins</a> for extra functionality and currently has over 80,000 active installations.</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://friends.pods.io/about-the-team/">six primary contributors</a> to the Pods plugin.  They have also brought on a React developer who is just getting started with UI work on Pods 2.8.  Other than work from the team, the project receives patches and contributions from the larger Pods community.</p>



<p>With the loss of funding from Automattic, Pods is receiving around $700 each month from donors. &ldquo;Once we found out that Automattic was going to focus their sponsorship funding towards other priorities of theirs, we put together a plan of action to reduce overall costs,&rdquo; said Clark.</p>



<p>The team&rsquo;s goal is to have at least 200 sponsors.  The average recurring monthly donation is about $17.  Coupled with their current 40 regular donors, they need an additional 160 at the same donation average to cover costs.  This would at least allow the team to be efficient with their time.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Right now our feature/fix development and support efforts will begin to suffer from lack of funding because we&rsquo;ll be spread too thin,&rdquo; said Clark.  &ldquo;I work a full-time job and can&rsquo;t pick up the extra weight entirely on my own.&rdquo;  Clark&rsquo;s job with Modern Tribe gives him some flexibility to work on the project, but it is minimal and only when time is available.</p>



<p>People who are willing to sponsor the project monthly can contribute via the <a href="https://friends.pods.io/donations/become-a-friend/">Friends of Pods</a> sponsorship page.  The project also has a <a href="https://friends.pods.io/donations/one-time-donation/">one-time donation option</a> for those wanting to go that route.</p>



<h2>Automattic Was Crucial to Success</h2>



<p>In his announcement, Clark said Automattic&rsquo;s decision to pull their sponsorship was because the company wanted to put their funds toward native Gutenberg projects.  Pods is a project that spans beyond Gutenberg.  However, it does have some Gutenberg integration and more features in the works.</p>



<p>Since 2012, Automattic has been the largest sponsor of Pods.  Their funding allowed the team to support and continue developing the plugin.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so appreciative of Automattic&rsquo;s support,&rdquo; said <a href="https://twitter.com/podsframework/status/1212792297911443456">Clark on Twitter</a>.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sponsored Pods for over 7 years, I know their decision was a tough one for them.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In 2011, <a href="https://wptavern.com/pods-what-happened-after-the-kickstarter-campaign">Pods surpassed its goal</a> in a Kickstarter campaign.  The project raised over $4,000 with a goal of $1,500.  The campaign was intended to fund the development of Pods 2.0.  In hindsight, the dollar amount was far too low to realistically fund such a complex project.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I naively thought that would be enough to accomplish everything and more we wanted to do for our big Pods 2.0 release,&rdquo; said Clark.  &ldquo;I was really wrong. Adding developers at a late stage in a project can take even more time than you anticipate. I also had to work around those developers&rsquo; schedules and spend time coordinating with them instead of building things myself. It was a huge challenge as I hadn&rsquo;t really led a team on a side project while having a full-time job before.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Clark had to reach into his pocket and put money towards the funding problem.  Yet, the team hit more roadblocks getting Pods 2.0 released.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I reached out to Automattic, which they offered to help out here and there to sponsor some more development&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;I was at the right job and had the right developers in place to really make the most of that arrangement. I had tons of time on the clock at work to build projects with Pods and I could build features/fix problems every day. With the added help of the funding, we were covered for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The arrangement was a blessing for the project, propelling it forward for years.  &ldquo;Without Automattic, we surely couldn&rsquo;t have continued on with the huge undertaking that the Pods 2.0 rewrite was,&rdquo; said Clark.  &ldquo;We would have just shelved everything and only added minor fixes/enhancements to Pods going forward.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Clark described the funding as crucial to maintaining a premium product for free.  &ldquo;Given what I know about many other free products out there, I can see why our support for Pods itself has sometimes been compared to premium support because of the people we could keep involved helping everyone with their project challenges and Pods questions,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>After success with Pods 2.0 and several releases, the Pods team reached back out to Automattic.  They were able to secure more funding with the agreement that they would diversify their funding and bring in more sponsors, which they were able to accomplish.</p>



<h2>What the Future Holds</h2>



<p>Clark is hopeful that they can meet their sponsorship goals.  If not, they may have to explore some commercial options.  However, he said Pods and its primary features will remain free of charge.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Development is not cheap,&rdquo; said Clark.  &ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;ve thought about diversifying our funding for a while, but ironically our sponsorship agreement with Automattic prohibited us from exploring premium add-ons to help fund more growth.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While the funding was a blessing, it may have also been a crutch.  &ldquo;If we had suddenly gotten millions of active installs to support, we would have been in big trouble,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t scale sponsorships with a growing userbase.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Clark said he is committed to making sure the next three major feature releases go out for free as part of the main Pods plugin, regardless of the funding situation.  &ldquo;I believe in making it easy to build projects in WordPress and some of those features are just really crucial to normal projects,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>The team is exploring the potential for premium add-ons.  However, if going that route, the add-ons would be with useful features that go beyond the core needs of the plugin.  &ldquo;We have some really awesome features that we&rsquo;ve always wanted to do and this could be the avenue to build them while giving huge value to our Friends of Pods,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;This could be an added benefit to them for supporting our project, which they&rsquo;d get as a reward for keeping their Friends of Pods membership active.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The future is uncertain.  The project is not in danger of disappearing at this point.  However, the reality is that development and support have real-world costs that need to be met.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still too early to know exactly what we can do with the funding we have and what we can expect to get from our 2020 fundraising efforts,&rdquo; said Clark.  &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if those ongoing funding struggles will prevent us from spending time to build new add-ons to generate new revenue either. It&rsquo;s all up in the air right now.&rdquo;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Jan 2020 17:59:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h2>WordPress 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 Releases</h2>



<p>The WordPress 5.3.1 security and maintenance release was announced on December 13. It features 46 fixes and enhancements. This version corrects four security issues in WordPress versions 5.3 and earlier. Shortly afterwards, WordPress 5.3.2 was released, addressing a couple high severity Trac tickets, and includes 5 fixes and enhancements, so you’ll want to upgrade. You can read more about these releases in the announcements for <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2019/12/wordpress-5-3-1-security-and-maintenance-release/">5.3.1</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2019/12/wordpress-5-3-2-maintenance-release/">5.3.2</a>.</p>



<h2>Update on the Nine Core Projects for 2019</h2>



<p>At the end of 2018, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>matt</a> <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/">announced</a> the nine projects that would be the main focus areas for Core development in the next year. Have we made progress? Yes! <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>chanthaboune</a> <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/12/06/update-9-projects-for-2019/">posted a full update</a> on the team’s work. In brief, two of the projects have been completed and shipped in major releases, four are targeted for release in versions 5.4 and 5.5 of WordPress, and the remaining three have seen significant progress but are not yet slated for completion. These will continue to see progress throughout 2020.</p>

<h2>WordPress Major Release Calendar</h2>



<p>The Core team has published <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/21/tentative-release-calendar-2020-2021/">a tentative release calendar</a> for 2020 and 2021. This is intended to provide the community with more information about what lies ahead.</p>



<p>The schedule is considered tentative because there are always variables that could affect these plans — not least that the Core team may need more time to finish the work planned for a release.</p>



<h2>Initial Documentation for Block-Based WordPress Themes</h2>



<p>The Gutenberg team has started working on <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18890/files">the initial documentation</a> for what block-based themes might look like, marking a significant change in the way themes are conceptualized. With full-site editing now a realistic goal for WordPress, themes will certainly look different in the future.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that if you were to purchase every single one of those books, it would be about $349. You could get them all for nothing from your local library, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200747550">even on a Kindle</a>. The money I spend on books is by far and away the best investment I make every year —&nbsp;books expand my mind and enrich my life in a way that nothing else does.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 07:00:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>One of our internal discussions about the future of WP Tavern has stuck with me since it wrapped up.  The discussion was centered on pushing comment threads in the right direction.  We often receive comments that border on conspiracy-theory territory (<em>and those that cross over head first</em>).  We also get comments that make statements of fact without backing up those claims with evidence.</p>



<p>Not all those who make such comments have ill intentions.  The issue is often that the ideas presented in a comment are not fully-fleshed out.  Often, the commentator had not taken the time to shape their words into something that births thoughtful responses.  Such is the nature of comments on the web.</p>



<p>WP Tavern&rsquo;s big goal for 2020 should be about shepherding our community.  Going forward, we will take steps toward fostering better discussions.</p>



<h2>Building Our Community in the New Year</h2>



<p>Shepherding the community is about creating a welcoming environment for everyone.  All of our readers should feel comfortable leaving their thoughts on a given topic.</p>



<p>As a new writer in a long-standing community, I sometimes receive uplifting private messages and emails from community members.  They often have kind words or love the coverage of a specific topic.  The trouble is getting some of those people to engage in the comments.  As my grandma, who would welcome anyone into her home, would say, &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all stop by sometime and chat for a while.&rdquo;  Some people are timid about commenting publicly.  Others feel like they will be attacked or their ideas will be dismissed offhand.  Fostering a community they would feel comfortable participating in is the goal.</p>



<p>The first step toward this goal is an <a href="https://wptavern.com/comment-policy">update to our comment policy</a>.</p>



<p>The intention of our policy has remained the same.  In general, be kind to people.  The updated policy includes some new guidelines on what is unacceptable and some clearer language in some areas.  It would be nice to eventually move back to the point where we no longer moderated every comment before publishing them on the site.  We are not there yet, but I remain optimistic.</p>



<p>The other major plan is around integrating community elements into the site design.  Rest assured that this is something being worked on.  Better showcasing recent comments is high on the list.  However, we can go beyond that by showcasing users with the most comments, top comments by the number of likes, and more.  I have some ideas that I hope to implement this year to make our readers feel like they have more of a stake in the site.  This place is as much about you all as it is about our team.</p>



<h2>Ask the Bartender</h2>



<p>We have quietly added an <a href="https://wptavern.com/contact-me/ask-the-bartender">Ask the Bartender</a> form on the site.  This is our idea of an advice column that you might see in traditional journalism.</p>



<p>At this point, it is experimental.  The plan is to publish a periodic article where one of our writers answers questions from our readers.  This will give you all an opportunity to bring up the big questions that you want our community to discuss.</p>



<p>We do not have an official format for how this will work yet.  It will largely depend on the questions that people submit.  We are open to nearly any type of WordPress-related question right now.</p>



<h2>What We All Can Do</h2>



<p>The biggest thing I ask of the Tavern community that we make 2020 the year that we thoughtfully engage with one another. </p>



<p>More than that, when discussing topics with others online, there is no need to feel like you must win an argument.  That usually leads to nowhere good.  Present your ideas and let them stand on their own merit.</p>



<p>With that idea in mind, think about writing responses in the form of a blog post.  Then, let us know about the post here at the Tavern.  Taking the time to write a post allows your ideas to mature.  Doing this lets you build a stronger argument if you rationally think it through.  Also, WordPress is blogging software at heart.  We should use it more often to blog about WordPress.</p>



<p>Happy New Year, everyone!  Let&rsquo;s make this a memorable one.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Jan 2020 21:01:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Another year is in the bag.  With a project as large and far-reaching as WordPress, there was no shortage of news and controversy.  We covered a lot of stories in 2019 and are gearing up for another exciting year.</p>



<p>I always like to take a moment at the end of the year to look over everything that happened.  Despite how well a website or project performs, it is good to take stock of each success.  It is a time of reflection.  Even in bad years, you should be able to find positive things to remember.  This helps shape how you view your websites, projects, or even life.  Ending the year remembering those positive things can help propel you into the new year.</p>



<p>It is equally important to find areas for improvement.  However, you cannot understand what the next steps are until you have taken a look at where you have been. </p>



<p>With that in mind, let&rsquo;s take a moment to reflect on the past year&rsquo;s journey for WP Tavern and WordPress.</p>



<h2>WP Tavern Stats</h2>



<p>In 2019, WP Tavern published 382 posts.  That is an increase of 52 posts over 2018.</p>



<p>Average words per post are the highest in WP Tavern&rsquo;s history, coming in at 587 words.  I am certain my long-windedness played a small role in that.  We also had fewer quick posts on the whole.  That is a format we should experiment with more.</p>



<p>Total and average comments are down.  Admittedly, we have been a bit heavy-handed with deleting comments that break our comment policy this year.  Average Jetpack-powered &ldquo;likes&rdquo; per post are at an all-time high (6.9 likes per post).  Total likes are the second-highest for a year (2,614 likes).  We are also seeing a lot of engagement on Twitter.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out in 2020 with social media having such a stronghold on how people engage with one another online.</p>



<p>We need to continue improving both the frequency and the quality of comments.</p>



<h2>The Year in WordPress</h2>



<p>WordPress <a href="https://wptavern.com/happy-sweet-16-wordpress">turned 16 years old</a> this year.  <em>It&rsquo;s old enough to drive now.</em></p>



<p>The community enjoyed three major updates throughout the year:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-1-improves-editor-performance-encourages-users-to-update-outdated-php-versions">Version 5.1 &ldquo;Betty&rdquo;</a> improved editor performance and encouraged users to update PHP.</li><li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-jaco-released-includes-fatal-php-error-protection-and-a-recovery-mode">Version 5.2 &ldquo;Jaco&rdquo;</a> included PHP fatal error protection and a recovery mode.</li><li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-3-kirk-released-brings-new-default-theme-editor-improvements-and-ui-tweaks">Version 5.3 &ldquo;Kirk&rdquo;</a> introduced the Twenty Twenty theme and made significant UI tweaks.</li></ul>



<p>Most of the year was focused on the Gutenberg plugin and porting its features and improvements into WordPress.  WP Tavern covered nearly <a href="https://wptavern.com/tag/gutenberg">everything you ever wanted to know about Gutenberg</a>.</p>



<p>Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2019-recap-all-roads-lead-to-the-block-editor">2019 State of the Word</a> primarily focused on the work that went into the block editor in the past 12 months.  He also outlined the next phases of the project, which include full-site customization, collaboration between post authors, and multilingual sites.</p>



<h2>Alex Mills (Viper007Bond) Passed Away</h2>



<p>In February, the WordPress community lost one of its greatest members, Alex Mills, as his <a href="https://wptavern.com/alex-mills-ends-his-battle-with-leukemia">battle with leukemia ended</a>.  Alex was a mentor and hero to many of us.  As a developer, I learned more from his work than I may ever be able to pay forward.  We never met in person, but he was one of my early teachers by simply leading the way for people like me.</p>



<p>His <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin also saved me countless hours over the years.  I cannot imagine building or testing WordPress themes without it.  <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-adopts-alex-mills-plugins">Automattic adopted the plugins</a> Alex built during his WordPress journey.</p>



<p>Alex, thank you for everything you contributed to the WordPress community.</p>



<h2>Favorites From 2019</h2>



<p>The following are various WordPress and Tavern-related things that I found most interesting throughout 2019.</p>



<h3>Posts From Tavern Writers</h3>



<p>We have had numerous well-written stories from everyone who has contributed in 2019.  The following are personal favorites from contributors other than myself that I wanted to highlight before we close the year out.  </p>



<p>These are my favorites for various reasons and presented in no particular order.  Sometimes, I liked the content of the article.  At other times, I appreciated them for how well-written they were.  If you missed them, now is a good time to hop back and check out some stories our team has written this year.</p>

<h3>My Articles</h3>



<p>I am closing in on 70 posts since becoming a fulltime contributor to WP Tavern.  This job has allowed me to explore a variety of topics in a few months, and I look forward to continuing this into 2020.  I enjoyed writing many stories, but there were two that I was particularly happy to have the opportunity to cover.</p>



<p>The first was my coverage of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/u-s-supreme-court-denies-dominos-appeal-to-determine-whether-websites-must-be-accessible">U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s denial of Domino&rsquo;s appeal</a> to determine whether its website must be accessible to all of its customers.  This story helped me jump far outside my comfort zone of strictly writing about WordPress and development topics.  It was also a stark reminder that we, as a community, need to become better at making the web accessible for all people.</p>



<p>The post I enjoyed working on the most was <a href="https://wptavern.com/chilean-news-publication-el-soberano-first-to-launch-on-newspack">El Soberano&rsquo;s launch on Newspack</a>.  The interesting thing about covering this story was not the actual re-launch of the publication.  It was getting to chat with other journalists, particularly those who were down in the trenches and fighting for justice.  It reminded me that, at the end of the day, journalism is always about people.</p>



<h3>Favorite Theme</h3>



<p>This was an easy pick.  <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/">Twenty Twenty</a> takes the top spot on my list.  There were themes released this year with designs better-suited to my tastes.  There were certainly other themes pushing more limits in terms of functionality.</p>



<p>What I like most about Twenty Twenty is that it seems unafraid to be bold.  It showcases how a theme can have personality while being designed around the block editor.  I am not sure if I would ever use it for my sites simply because it&rsquo;s not my preferred style.  However, I appreciate its artistic merit.</p>



<h3>Favorite Plugin</h3>



<p>While it was not released in 2019, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/">GiveWP</a> is the most interesting plugin I have used this year.  It is a fundraising plugin that allows WordPress users to accept donations directly from their website.</p>



<p>I worked with the plugin in two capacities this year.  The first was as a plugin developer who was building an integration between it and another plugin.  As a developer, I appreciated how well-written and well-documented the code was.  The team behind the plugin includes top-notch programmers.</p>



<p>I also helped push a couple of friends to set it up for their projects.  Both were pleased with their experiences.</p>



<h2>Top 10 Posts From 2019</h2>



<p>The following posts are the most-commented posts of the year.  Loads of comments typically mean controversy around here, so this list may contain, more or less, the most controversial topics of the year.  Either way, there are some great discussions in some of the comment threads.</p>

<p>The WordPress Theme Review Team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/12/30/new-color-alpha-package-available/">announced its color picker control</a> today.  The project is a single package that allows theme authors to include an advanced color control in the customizer.  The control allows users to select a hex color with an optional alpha channel to handle transparency.</p>



<p>The color control is the fourth feature package released by the team in 2019.  The <a href="https://wptavern.com/justin-tadlock-proposes-idea-to-solve-common-theme-issues">idea for feature packages</a> took off in June.  Feature packages are repositories for single features that theme authors may use in their themes.  Their purpose is to standardize common features so that developers do not have to <em>recreate the wheel</em>, so to speak.</p>



<p>Arguably, the color control is the most complex package the team has built.  The bulk of the work was handled by feature packages lead, Ari Stathopoulos.  The project is available via its <a href="https://github.com/WPTRT/control-color-alpha">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wptrt/control-color-alpha">Packagist</a>.</p>



<p>Officially, the team launched version 1.0 in October, but the project has undergone some changes since its release.  Initially, the project utilized the Iris color picker script included with WordPress.  However, the team ran into trouble making it work as they wanted with RGBA colors.  The team refactored the project to use <a href="https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/">React Color</a> instead.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The main issue with this project was the thing that WordPress is most famous for &mdash; backward-compatibility,&rdquo; said Stathopoulos.  &ldquo;Compatibility is one of WP&rsquo;s greatest assets, but at the same time, a pain for developers. Things don&rsquo;t get updated because they need to work for plugin A/B/C that hasn&rsquo;t been updated in 6 years. So scripts like the Iris picker, things that were great half a decade ago, have been abandoned and are just dead weight. RGBA support could easily have been in WP core&rsquo;s picker.  There was always a demand for it.  But it never happened.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The team decided to move forward without relying on past solutions.   Stathopoulos said the biggest hurdle with building the control to use React Color was making it look native to WordPress.  He described the project as an example for others to see that it was possible to use React in the customizer.</p>



<p>Setting up the control with the basics is relatively easy.  Theme authors should be able to quickly integrate it into their themes by following the <a href="https://github.com/WPTRT/control-color-alpha/blob/v1.1.2/README.md#usage">usage instructions</a>.  Color data is stored as a hex value (e.g., <code>#000000</code>) if there is no transparency or as a RGBA value (e.g., <code>rgba(0,0,0,0)</code>) if there is.</p>



<p>The control does come with more advanced features.  For example, it is possible to store color data as an array, which includes a slew of information, such as:</p>



<ul><li>RGB (red, green, blue)</li><li>HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)</li><li>Alpha transparency</li><li>Hex</li><li>CSS value</li><li>Accessibility properties</li></ul>



<p>The accessibility properties are interesting and may allow theme authors to help to ensure users choose colors that meet accessibility standards.  Some of the included data is the color&rsquo;s luminance, contrast with white and black, max contrast color, and more.</p>



<h2>The Future of Feature Packages</h2>



<p>Currently, the TRT&rsquo;s feature packages are not widely adopted by theme authors.  The overall project is still in its infancy.  In the wake of the news that WordPress will be moving toward full-site editing, the team is not sure what that will mean for the project going forward.</p>



<p>Stathopoulos said that some theme authors are hesitant to do big things at the moment.  It&rsquo;s a tough sell to get developers on board when the future of theme development is in a holding pattern, waiting for the other Gutenberg shoe to drop.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been discussing and thinking of what packages we should build,&rdquo; said Stathopoulos.  &ldquo;The problem is that the editor is the centerpiece of WordPress.  Everything else just surrounds the editor.  Gutenberg is expanding, and it looks like it&rsquo;s taking over everything else in WordPress. So we think the next packages should be around the editor too.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He said some of the initial package ideas like a standardized hook system, more customizer controls, and accessible menus may not be the best route.  Those ideas may not make sense in the context of a block-editing world.  The team could see the launch of such packages dead on arrival.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tricky, transitional period for themes and theme developers,&rdquo; said Stathopoulos.  &ldquo;We all need to learn how to better leverage the editor.&rdquo;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 20:28:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Joshua Wold, co-representative for the WordPress design team, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/12/23/author-card-block-exploration/">shared an early exploration</a> of an author card block.  Community members explored several ideas at the design table during the contributor day at WordCamp US 2019.  In the post, Wold followed up on the original sketches from that melding of design minds.</p>



<p>The original idea for the author block was a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1844">GitHub ticket</a> created in July 2017, but it was far ahead of its time.  The Gutenberg project needed to focus on the basics and more common blocks for post content at that point.  Now is the time to shift gears and begin work on these more complex blocks that will likely be a large part of the full-site editing phase of the project.</p>



<p>Currently, there are several proposed components to the author block:</p>



<ul><li>Image/Avatar</li><li>Name</li><li>Description/Biography</li><li>Website Link</li><li>Social Network Links</li><li>Recommended Posts</li></ul>



<p>I am on the fence about a recommended posts option as part of the block.  If they were recommended posts written by that author, it could be an interesting concept to explore.  However, version 1 of the block should focus on the most common elements, which the other components in the list cover.</p>



<p>Wold asked four key questions about the future of the block.  The following are my responses to each.</p>



<h2>What Is the Value of the Block and How Will It Be Used?</h2>



<p>Coming from the theme world, what surprises me is that WordPress has never standardized on this feature at this point.  Author bio sections are commonplace in theme development.  Core should have standardized this feature years ago.  We have a standard search form, comment list, featured image, and more.  Many of the features that WordPress has standardized over the years were born out of theme designers carving the path forward, and author bios are no different.</p>



<p>It has long made sense for an author bio template tag to exist.  However, we are living in a block world.  The concept has merely shifted.</p>



<p>We do not need an author bio block today.  We will need it tomorrow.  As we shift closer and closer to full-site editing, we need to be building, iterating, and testing these types of blocks in preparation for the point of no return.  This block, along with similar blocks, should drop in core at the same time the switch is flipped on full-site editing.</p>



<p>The primary use case will be for end-users to edit their theme&rsquo;s block templates to stick the author bio at the end of their single post views.  However, such a block need not be limited to that scenario.  Users could create a &ldquo;team&rdquo; or &ldquo;authors&rdquo; page on their site.  Some may want to drop these into columns or create some sort of gallery of author bios.</p>



<p>I could see taking this even further and naming it a &ldquo;user bio&rdquo; block.  Use cases do not have to be centered around the concept of an author.</p>



<h2>Where Should the Author Data Come From?</h2>



<p>The primary, or at least initial, source of data should come from user data and metadata stored in the database.  It does not make sense to duplicate efforts by retyping content within the block if it already exists.</p>



<p>One big question will be around social icons.  If these are a part of the block, there is no current source to pull the URLs from.  If automatically generating the data, WordPress will need to add social media contact methods to the user profile screen in the admin.  That can be a slippery slope when deciding which social networks to include.  However, core WordPress could stick to three or four major networks and provide a filter hook for plugin authors to utilize along with a standard for how additional fields are handled.</p>



<p>There is also the possibility that this block could simply be a pre-defined pattern of existing, smaller blocks that pulled in data like a user biography, user social icons, and user avatar.  Then, the site owner could move other blocks in and out as they saw fit.</p>



<h2>What Block Design Options Should Be Available?</h2>



<p>The obvious design options are the standard text color, background color, and font size options.  <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16848">Border design options</a> would be a bonus, but that goes beyond the scope of this specific block.</p>



<p>The standard alignment options would be welcome, particularly center, wide, and full.  An alignment option for the avatar image to shift it left or right could also be useful.  It could work similarly to the existing Media &amp; Text core block.</p>



<p>I would not go overboard with design options.  Let theme authors create custom block styles for users to choose from.  That is the theme author&rsquo;s job.</p>



<h2>What Additional Features Should the Block Handle?</h2>



<p>Outside of an avatar and biography, a social icon list is the most necessary feature.  It is almost ubiquitous with author bio boxes.</p>



<p>What I would like to see is an author/user &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; block that builds upon this initial idea.  At the moment, I am already imagining the painful user experience of creating a team page and putting individual user bio blocks into columns.  Then, I am further imagining having to update that page and potentially move columns around.  As an end-user, there are times when I want to micro-manage certain aspects of my site.  This would not be one of them.  Just give me a simple block to list user bios in some sort of columnized format.</p>



<p>Such a block could provide an avenue for many types of options.  Maybe an option to list authors of a certain post type.  Perhaps an option to list users by role.  Or, let me list the top users by post count.</p>



<p>This idea may be pushing over into plugin territory.  However, in terms of what I would want to do with my sites, this would be high on the list.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 20:00:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The update includes around two dozen features, improvements, and fixes.  The biggest feature update was the inclusion of a new plugin sidebar for the block editor.</p>



<p>Some of the new features include a filter for unlimited focus keywords, an email notification each time the plugin is automatically updated, and a warning when using the review Schema type.  It also improved compatibility with the Elementor plugin&rsquo;s sitemap module and added Advanced Custom Fields integration to the sidebar.  A full list of features is available in the plugin&rsquo;s <a href="https://rankmath.com/changelog/">public change log</a>.</p>



<p>The team has a <a href="https://s.rankmath.com/demo">public demo available</a> for end-users to test the plugin without having to install it on their sites.</p>



<p>Bhanu Ahluwalia, co-founder and CMO at Rank Math, said that everyone on the team had been experimenting with the Gutenberg plugin since the first beta was released.  &ldquo;We had some experience with Gutenberg, but working on Rank Math has taught us so many things and helped us on so many levels,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>It was not always a smooth journey.  Ahluwalia said the team wanted to keep the plugin lightweight and not sacrifice speed with new technologies.  &ldquo;We had to learn React, Webpack, ES6, etc.,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;In essence, we had to re-learn patterns, practices, and pitfalls of Gutenberg, and we had to do it all with little-to-no documentation available. We had to dive deep into the code and get ourselves familiar with every line of code to ensure nothing interfered with the existing functions of our plugin.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>Testing the Block Editor Sidebar</h2>



<img />Rank Math sidebar as seen in the block editor.



<p>Immediately upon activating the update, I noted the Rank Math button at the top right of the editor.  Admittedly, I was not happy with the space the button took up or its difference in design when compared to other plugin sidebar buttons.  Instead of a simple icon, the button includes both an icon and an SEO score.  As more and more plugins and themes begin adding sidebars of their own, this space could become cluttered quickly.  I would like to see this scaled back to simply be an icon and not take up precious screen real estate.</p>



<p>The plugin manages to pack a ton of options and information into a tight spot.  Once viewing the plugin sidebar, it presents four sub-tabs (General, Advanced, Schema, and Social), each with custom panels or sections.  While I am not generally a fan of complex SEO plugins and prefer solutions such as <a href="https://wptavern.com/slim-seo-keeps-options-simple-and-handles-the-legwork-of-seo">Slim SEO</a>, the plugin handles the interface gracefully.</p>



<p>In comparison to the old meta boxes, the interface is a huge step up.  The meta box system used in previous versions of the plugin or with the current Classic editor is cumbersome at best.  The team had to get more creative to pull off a solution for the sidebar, which forced them to tighten up the interface.</p>



<p>Not all users were happy with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sidebar-really/">narrow space</a> provided by the new sidebar.  The Rank Math team was ahead of the game and included a <a href="https://rankmath.com/kb/filters-hooks-api-developer/#disable-gutenberg-sidebar">filter hook to disable</a> this feature.  Disabling will return the old-style meta box at the bottom of the post-editing area.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Supporting both the Classic Editor and Gutenberg at once with a single plugin is hectic to say the least,&rdquo; said Ahluwalia. &ldquo;We would rather put our energy into a single editing experience, but seeing how WordPress is evolving after Gutenberg, we have to double our efforts to offer a consistent user experience.&rdquo;</p>



<p>At the moment, the team plans to continue supporting the classic editor until at least 2022.  &ldquo;Depending on the user feedback and the acceptance of the Classic editor, we can continue to support it even further,&rdquo; said Ahluwalia.</p>

The goal is to bring the block directory to the admin in WordPress 5.5, which is currently <a href="https://wptavern.com/progress-on-wordpress-2019-projects-sets-2020-roadmap">set for August 2020 on the roadmap</a>.  The post also outlines reusable components that can be used in other areas of the admin in the long term.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Y4jCNPkjCuSRiGYEoaAZujhm/Gutenberg-Block-Directory-wp-admin?node-id=1460%3A277&viewport=366%2C373%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom">Figma prototype</a> is available for those who want to give it a test run.  It is important to remember that this is an early version and many things can change by the time the block directory lands in WordPress.</p>



<p>The prototype was built after feedback from the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/07/11/block-directory-in-wp-admin-concepts/">first round of concepts shared</a> in July on the Make Design blog.</p>



<p>For this admin project to be successful, WordPress plugin developers will need to start submitting blocks to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/">block directory</a> on WordPress.org.  At the moment, there are only 10 blocks listed.  Getting in early will give block authors an edge on the competition.  The block directory has a few <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/12/06/block-directory-plugin-guidelines/">additional guidelines</a> beyond normal plugins that authors should review.</p>



<h2>About Blocks Screen</h2>



<img />About Blocks admin screen.



<p>The About Blocks screen is the primary blocks admin screen.  It appears to be an informational page with resources for users to learn more about using blocks on their sites.  It also has links to development resources for designing and building blocks.  </p>



<p>Making this information directly available, especially to users, would be a smart decision if it makes it into the final design.  As we move toward an entirely new way to build websites with WordPress, it is important to provide learning tools to users.  This seemed to be one of the missing components when the block editor first launched in core.  If done right, it could ease the burden on new users and old users who are transitioning to the new editor.</p>



<p>The above screenshot also shows the new admin screen header proposal.  The page title is followed by a short description of what the screen is about.  Followed the intro are action links on the left and meta-type links on the right.  I am a fan of the generous use of whitespace and extra information.</p>



<h2>Add Blocks Screen</h2>



<img />Add Blocks screen.



<p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Y4jCNPkjCuSRiGYEoaAZujhm/Gutenberg-Block-Directory-(wp-admin)?node-id=1460%3A2958&viewport=366%2C373%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom">add blocks screen</a> is similar to the current new plugin screen in the WordPress admin.  The primary &ldquo;Featured&rdquo; tab (the tab opened when first visiting the screen) is broken down into various sections, such as &ldquo;Blocks We Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Popular Tags.&rdquo;</p>



<p>One of the more interesting sections of this page is the &ldquo;Top Authors&rdquo; list.  This concept would be a great way to give recognition to block authors who are building useful blocks for the community.</p>



<p>There is also a &ldquo;Recent Blocks&rdquo; section near the bottom of the page.  I would rather see a top tab for that.  It feels a bit buried in the current design.  New plugin and theme authors already struggle to break into popular lists.  Recently-added blocks should be higher up the page or have a dedicated tab/page to showcase them a bit more.</p>



<h2>Installed Blocks Screen</h2>



<img />Installed Blocks screen.



<p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Y4jCNPkjCuSRiGYEoaAZujhm/Gutenberg-Block-Directory-(wp-admin)?node-id=1460%3A2958&viewport=366%2C373%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom">block installation screen</a> is similar to the existing installed plugins screen in core and lists all of the blocks that are installed.  There are also active and inactive tabs.  Improvements here are primarily around list table design.  On the whole, they are minor adjustments, but the look of the tables is much nicer.  <em>Can we have this in core, across the board, now?</em></p>



<p>A new element is the &ldquo;Instances&rdquo; column, which lists the number of times a block has been used on the site.  By clicking the number, you are taken to a new screen that lists the posts the block has been used in.  It also displays the instances for each post.  This would be a useful feature for deciding whether to deactivate or remove a block.</p>



<p>Side note to this:  I have worked on numerous projects in the past where I was doing cleanup and attempting to figure out if a plugin, especially those with shortcodes, were in use on the site.  Showing the instances count for blocks is brilliant.</p>



<h2>Manage Blocks Screen</h2>



<img />Manage Blocks screen.



<p>Plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/">EditorsKit</a> have had built-in block management for a while.  However, this feature feels like it should be in core WordPress.  There are numerous core blocks that some users will likely never use.  Having the ability to hide them from the block inserter will reduce clutter and make it easier to find the blocks they need.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Y4jCNPkjCuSRiGYEoaAZujhm/Gutenberg-Block-Directory-(wp-admin)?node-id=1460%3A14224&viewport=366%2C373%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom">block management screen</a> will allow users to activate or deactivate any specific block on their website.  Like the block installation screen, it also displays the number of instances a block is in use.</p>



<h2>Reusable Blocks Screen</h2>



<img />Reusable Blocks screen.



<p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Y4jCNPkjCuSRiGYEoaAZujhm/Gutenberg-Block-Directory-(wp-admin)?node-id=1460%3A15861&viewport=366%2C373%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom">reusable blocks screen</a> is already available in WordPress.  It does not currently have an admin menu link, so it is not easily discoverable.  You can view it by going to the <code>yoursite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block</code> URL or clicking the &ldquo;Manage All Reusable Blocks&rdquo; link under the &ldquo;Reusable&rdquo; tab in the block inserter.</p>



<p>This screen allows users to manage blocks that are stored for reuse within multiple posts.  Like the installation and management screens, the prototype displays an instances column for tracking how often the block has been used.</p>



<p>Users can import and export reusable blocks.  It will be interesting to see if more WordPress users start sharing their block creations with others once this screen has better exposure or if it will be something people simply use to copy blocks from site to site.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 21:09:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

No security issues were named in this update.  Instead, 5.3.2 addresses a couple of high-priority bugs along with a few other issues.</p>



<p>Users with automatic updates enabled should already be updated to the latest version or will receive an update soon.  Other users should update as soon as they are able, especially if their installation is affected by any of the following issues.</p>



<p>The first high-priority fix addressed an issue with modified post objects that have an invalid date.  The fix ensures that the <code>get_feed_build_date()</code> function handles this scenario.  The documentation was updated to clarify the function will return <code>false</code> on failure.  This change also led to a comparison-check fix in the test tools when inserting a post with a future or published status.</p>



<p>The second major bug fixed in 5.3.2 was an edge case where unique file names could clash.  On case-sensitive systems, the <code>wp_unique_filename()</code> function failed to rename some files when the uploaded file matched an existing file with an uppercase file extension.  The fix addresses a fatal error in those cases.</p>



<p>Developers tackled another issue with the <code>wp_unique_filename()</code> function.  When a destination directory for an uploaded file was unreadable, WordPress was throwing PHP warnings.  The fix includes only running the final filename-collision test for files that are saved to the user&rsquo;s <code>/uploads</code> directory.</p>



<p>Building off the accessibility work in the previous release, buttons with the <code>.active</code> class are now properly styled in the non-default admin color schemes.  On some screens, particularly the Permalinks admin screen, active buttons had white text on a light gray background, making them unreadable.</p>



<p>Users who wish to do so, can <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-3-2/">view the full release documentation</a> from WordPress.</p>



<p>With the widespread usage of automatic updates, it would be nice to see more of these quicker releases during the development cycle.  Maybe weekly releases are a bit much.  However, shipping a few extra minor releases between major upgrades would be a good opportunity to knock out some of the 6,500 Trac tickets on <a href="https://wptavern.com/progress-on-wordpress-2019-projects-sets-2020-roadmap">WordPress&rsquo; 2020 roadmap</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:19:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>It is not the first time the question has been asked in the WordPress community and will not be the last.  It is important that we keep coming back to it from time to time.</p>



<p>In the early days of the commercial WordPress ecosystem, many shops sold products for a one-time fee.  This was particularly true during the 2007-2010 years, which were what many dub the &ldquo;WordPress themes heyday,&rdquo; a period in which theme shops raked in tons of cash due to lack of competition.</p>



<p>As the market became more saturated, many businesses saw the writing on the wall.  One-time fees for commercial themes or plugins did not make for a sustainable business model.  Of course, some companies pushed forward with that model.  They were either large enough to capitalize on an influx of new customers every year or they continued to push out new products for existing customers to buy.</p>



<p>Today, most theme and plugin shops utilize a recurring business model.  Many of those shops also set up automatic renewals.  From a business perspective, companies need to keep existing customers while bringing in new buyers to continue maintaining, supporting, and building new features for the current product catalog.  Companies also need growth to build new products.  A recurring fee helps ease the burden of supporting and maintaining the existing products.</p>



<p>Pippin Williamson <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/automatic-license-renewals-twenty-months-later/">saw massive revenue growth</a> over 20 months after turning on automatic renewals across his company&rsquo;s various products.  Other companies have seen similar increases with the same model.</p>



<p>As a former business owner, I <em>dumb-lucked</em> my way into yearly, recurring payments.  When I first launched a theme shop in 2008, that was the model I went with.  I did not know a single thing about running a business except that money exchanged hands.  I was in my early 20s and accustomed to living off minimum wage, digging change from the couch to buy a value meal, and finding creative ways &mdash; short of dumpster diving &mdash; to scrape by.  Anything better than that was a success for me.  Recurring payments just made sense, especially because I was vastly undercutting my competitors in price.  That one decision helped sustain my business for many years.  In hindsight, I would not have had the little success I had with a single-payment model because I never brought in enough new customers.</p>



<p>Having worked on the business end of WordPress for over a decade and being a member of the community for even longer, it is easy for me to say most companies should use a recurring business model.</p>



<p>However, as a software customer in general, I have not always maintained that mindset.  There are many pieces of software that I loathe paying for each year.  This was particularly true before running a business that dealt with software.  There is a part of me that feels some shame for disliking the recurring model with non-WordPress software.  Those businesses need to pay their employees and afford to continue making the product better.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is always that part of me that simply wants to pay for something once and always have access to it.  Perhaps I am a product of my culture.  Software is unlike other art forms where Version 1.0 is the finished product.  Customers do not always see the work that goes on to maintain, support, and continue building a product.  That is certainly true when I look at non-WordPress software.</p>



<p>For WordPress products, I am always more than happy to pay a recurring fee because I have been on the other side.  I also get to talk with others every day who are trying to run their own companies.  That human variable in the equation changes how I view software in the WordPress ecosystem in a way that is much harder with other software.</p>



<h2>A Middle Ground</h2>



<p>Starr pointed out a middle-of-the-road option that few WordPress companies take but is often the model used for other software products.  Major releases of software carry an upgrade fee while minor and patch releases are included with the initial purchase.  Often, major software releases have years in between.  Customers may not feel like they are constantly having to pay for updates in this system.  Major upgrades also mean feature upgrades.  Features are what sell the product to the average end-user.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">Scrivener</a>, a writing program for authors, uses this model.  Instead of having to pay yearly, I can upgrade to the new, shiny version when it drops with loads of features.  As a customer, I feel like I am getting something tangible when forking over the cash for an update.</p>



<p>Perhaps I am happy to continue paying for software that helps me pursue my lifelong dream of becoming a novelist.  Perhaps the company simply knows how to sell to its customer base.  Either way, it is one piece of software that I have never complained about renewing.</p>



<h2>What is the Best Option?</h2>



<p>To answer the question posed by Starr, I will always prefer a one-time fee as a customer simply because it is in my nature to want to pay the least amount I can for anything.  However, I would prefer most WordPress businesses to go with whatever model is most sustainable for their specific business.  We are all in this boat together, and I wish growth for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the missing pieces with many WordPress plugin and theme shops is that they need to find creative ways to sell the customer on coming back.  Support and maintenance can be eye-catching for agencies and freelancers, but they are not always selling points for the average consumer after that initial purchase.</p>

<p>In November, web hosting provider Bluehost <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/introducing-wordpress-themes-to-the-bluehost-marketplace-12981/">launched a WordPress plugin and theme marketplace</a>.  The company integrated with <a href="https://www.mojomarketplace.com/">MOJO Marketplace</a> to provide access to WordPress products via its customer dashboard.  Currently, the marketplace is open to third-party theme developers.  Plugin authors will have to wait, but they will eventually be able to sell their plugins through the Bluehost Marketplace.</p>



<p>By integrating with MOJO Marketplace, much of the existing infrastructure and products are already in place.  Bluehost can simply offer the products to its customers through a custom-built interface and provide MOJO sellers with another avenue for distribution.</p>



<p>The idea behind the marketplace is for Bluehost&rsquo;s customers to be able to build their websites without ever leaving their control panel.  &ldquo;Ultimately, we are trying to save customers time and energy from having to hunt for these things themselves and instead work within the dashboard to find the themes and plugins that are best fit for their site,&rdquo; said Suhaib Zaheer, general manager for Bluehost.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our native marketplace also provides our customers with the ability to automatically install the themes and plugins they have purchased, reducing the amount of time and number of steps required to get their site appearance and functionality up and running,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>The Bluehost Marketplace currently has over 900 themes and 18 WooCommerce plugins for customers to choose from.  The themes are all viewable via the <a href="https://www.mojomarketplace.com/themes/wordpress">WordPress themes page</a> on the MOJO website.  All themes uploaded by sellers go through a manual review process by the Bluehost Marketplace team before approval.  This includes basic items like design quality, functionality, installation, and documentation.</p>



<p>There is also a &ldquo;Bluehost Certified&rdquo; filter available to users who want to use themes that have been further tested for quality control.  &ldquo;We conduct additional reviews to certify themes for our Bluehost Certified category on a quarterly basis,&rdquo; said Zaheer .</p>



<p>There appear to be 85 themes that are Bluehost Certified based on a screenshot acquired of the marketplace.  However, that number is not verified.  The MOJO Marketplace page does not appear to have a filter to view these, but it is available to users of Bluehost&rsquo;s hosting service.</p>



<h2>Selling on the Bluehost Marketplace</h2>



<p>Theme developers who want to sell themes via Bluehost can apply through <a href="https://mojosupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200823136-Sellers">MOJO Marketplace</a>.  Authors should note that they would like to be Bluehost Certified.  </p>



<p>Theme sellers who want to get certification must meet the <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/certified-wordpress-themes">Bluehost Certified guidelines</a>.  Some are fairly normal and would be expected in today&rsquo;s market such as responsiveness, browser compatibility, fast load times, and active support from the author.</p>



<p>Others are a bit of a head-scratcher.  </p>



<p>Certification requires that themes support page builders.  It&rsquo;s unclear which page builders need to be supported and what level of support is necessary.  Ideally, this would be the other way around.  Page builders should be built in such a way that they do not need theme-specific support.</p>



<p>Demo content is required.  It is not clear if the requirements simply mean to provide an installable XML file with demo content or for the theme to output demo content in the absence of user content.  Based on the description, it seems like the latter.  If so, I would not want any part of that as a potential theme author.  I could see requiring the use of the WordPress starter content feature in this case but nothing more.</p>



<p>The requirements also list &ldquo;plugins supported&rdquo; with no additional description.  <em>Good luck to theme authors figuring out exactly what that means.</em></p>



<p>Bluehost needs to make its Bluehost Certified page more detailed to be attractive to potential theme authors.  There are far too many unanswered questions.</p>



<p><a href="https://mojosupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001076306-Commission-Rates">Commission rates</a> are the same rates as other themes on the MOJO Marketplace.  Themes sold exclusively through the marketplace earn between 50% and 70% based on the number of sales.  Non-exclusive theme commissions are at a flat rate of 50%.  Both exclusive and non-exclusive authors can distribute their themes through the Bluehost Marketplace.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Theme sellers are welcome to set the price of their item,&rdquo; said Zaheer.  &ldquo;However, we recommend they stay within $49-$69 range. If the review team does not feel the price is uniform with other themes in the same category, they will request a price change in order to be sold on the Marketplace.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The pricing recommendation seems to be a bit on the low end, but it is consistent with the theme industry&rsquo;s race to the bottom.  Quality theme work should be at least double.</p>



<p>Fortunately for theme authors, pricing is based on yearly renewals.  They are required to offer technical assistance within 24-48 hours while a user&rsquo;s yearly support license is up to date.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 20:40:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Using WordPress to power a slide deck isn’t an obvious choice, so we wanted to showcase the process and give some tips for making slide layouts using Gutenberg.</p>



<p><em>This post is co-written by Ella and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed/">Tammie</a>, who (along with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce/">Mel</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mapk/">Mark</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/nrqsnchz/">Enrique</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/itsjonq/">Q</a></em> <em>and a cast of supporters) helped create this year’s State of the Word slide deck.</em></p>



<h2>How it Started</h2>



<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ellatrix/">Ella Van Durpe</a> was selected to speak at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNWNhUPrqB4">JSConf</a> and ReactEurope and wanted slides for her presentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, she’d used Reveal.js to create slides and enjoyed the freedom to create anything using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages were comfortable, familiar, and also can be published on the web in their native format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these new presentations, she wanted to use Reveal.js again but didn’t feel like writing all the HTML by hand. Creating blocks of content visually, without having to actually write any code, which can be published natively to the web, is exactly what Gutenberg was built for.</p>



<p>The plugin was prototyped quickly, with hardcoded styles on the slides and zero options. At the end of each presentation, Ella shared a brief demo of the Gutenberg-based slides and the audience was amazed.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/ellatrx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ellatrx</a> any chance you might open source this? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> <a href="https://t.co/6hygMpBqUA">https://t.co/6hygMpBqUA</a></p>&mdash; Pascal Birchler (@swissspidy) <a href="https://twitter.com/swissspidy/status/1131573525612048385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
</div>



<p>As WordCamp US approached, Ella suggested that her plugin be used for State of the Word. Since it was such a hit with her audience members, it seemed like this would be a great chance to share it with the WordPress community as a whole.</p>



<span id="more-8233"></span>



<h2>How it Works</h2>



<h3>Technical information</h3>



<p>The plugin registers a custom post type called “presentation” and a new “slide” block. The slide block is a sort of enhanced “Group” block, which is restricted to the root of the post, but you can put any other block inside it. As a result, you have a post filled with only slides at the root and slides filled with content. This maps perfectly to the Reveal.js markup, which requires content in HTML section elements.</p>



<p>Since these slides each have their own design, the theme styles are disabled and styling is set from each slide. A custom presentation template is provided by the plugin to render the custom post on the front-end.</p>



<p>Then Ella added options to style the slides. For example, she added options to control the slide background and font, at both the document level and individual slide level. She also added Reveal.js options, which allow you to change the transition style and speed. Lastly, she added a custom CSS field to allow style overwrites.</p>



<p>For the State of the Word, she also added speaker notes and a speaker view.</p>

<h3>How it&#8217;s Designed</h3>

<p>The inspiration for the slide designs came from Blue Note album covers (which were also the inspiration for the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/photomatt/state-of-the-word-2011/">2011 State of the Word slides</a>). These album covers inspired the recent “About” page in WordPress core and the starter content for the new Twenty Twenty theme. This style consists of strong, geometric shapes and simple forms with clean lines. Photography and bold typography are at the heart of this look.</p>



<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?fit=632%2C541&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8267" />



<p>Various color palettes and font pairings were explored before selecting the best combination for the presentation.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?fit=632%2C407&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8259" />



<p>A strong photographic element was needed for the slides. Past WordCamps are a great source of photos, so we dug through years of photo galleries to find just the right shots. With colors, fonts, and photos, we laid the foundation to build the deck.</p>



<h2>Tips for Making Gutenberg Slides</h2>



<h3>Tip One: columns are your friends</h3>



<p>If you want slides with a precise layout, use columns. As you can see here, we used a 3 column layout to center content within a slide:</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/3.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8260" />



<h3>Tip Two: spacer blocks are useful</h3>



<p>Want to really unlock the power of columns? Combine them with the spacer block! We used spacer blocks to position content over background images, like in this slide:</p>



<img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/6.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8264" />



<h3>Tip Three: test on large screens</h3>



<p>It’s important to preview and test your slides as you go. Make sure to design for the size and aspect ratio of the projector you’ll be using and do a visual check in presentation mode from time to time.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?fit=632%2C405&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8269" />



<h3>Tip Four: check your videos</h3>



<p>A good demo video is integral to showcase new features. Joen Asmussen has a great post on <a href="https://automattic.design/2019/11/12/good-ui-demo-videos/">creating effective demo videos</a>.</p>



<h2>Lessons learned</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I’d love to make the art directed compositions easier to create. </em></p><cite><em>Mel Choyce-Dwan</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>As Gutenberg evolves, one big improvement is that art direction will get easier. Even with the improvements this year, creating some layouts in Gutenberg was trickier than expected. For the more complicated compositions, we relied on SVGs. Eventually, the need for hacks will dissolve away, and a new world of exciting possibilities will open for everyone.</p>



<p>Browsers offered one of our biggest learnings in this presentation, more than they would if you use Keynote or Powerpoint, for example (tools most of us have used). Often, we found that what we created in the editor varied a when viewed full-screen. We were able to mitigate this by updating the plugin to use a fixed size, instead of using the entire browser window.</p>

In a few short months, it will be my 17th <em>blog-aversary</em>.  The most important lesson I have learned over the years is to not do more work than is necessary to publish a blog post.</p>



<p>There was a time when I fiddled with custom field boxes to fine-tune every aspect of a blog post, such as meta keywords, descriptions, titles, and much more.  However, worrying over every bit of metadata about a post became more work than actually writing the blog post itself.  It was killing my creative process.</p>



<p>I have tried numerous SEO plugins and even built such a plugin myself once.  Eventually, I would always come back to simply automating most of the process for whatever project I was working on.</p>



<p>Some SEO purists may balk at the idea.  They might argue that everything must be fine-tuned for the best results in search engines.  I could not say.  Worrying about ranking seems to be a never-ending, uphill battle.  In my experience, no particular plugin has ever given me an edge in comparison to another.  Results were always similar regardless of whether I fixated on every detail that options-filled SEO plugins offered or let an automated system generate the bits and pieces I needed.</p>



<p>I decided to give the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/slim-seo/">Slim SEO plugin</a> a try.  It promised to handle the dirty work and ticked most of the boxes in terms of what I was looking for in an SEO plugin.</p>



<p>Slim SEO is a plugin built by eLightUp, the company behind the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/">Meta Box</a> framework and <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/author/gretathemes/">GretaThemes</a>.  Given their history of building quality extensions for WordPress, their SEO plugin made sense for a test run.</p>



<p>The plugin beautifully handles the basics that you would expect from an SEO plugin.  It automatically handles meta tags, including Open Graph Tags for social media.  It generates a sitemap of your public posts and pages.  It outputs structured data via JSON-LD with no work on the user&rsquo;s part.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> For users who are looking for a simple SEO solution with little legwork, Slim SEO is a solid option.  For users who want to tinker with every aspect of their SEO, look elsewhere.</p>



<h2>A Slim User Interface</h2>



<p>As a user, the things I tire of quickly the most are complex options screens.  <em>Just give me the basics.</em>  That is exactly what Slim SEO does.  It has a single options screen titled &ldquo;SEO&rdquo; under the default &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu in the admin.  Currently, the only options are for inputting header and footer scripts from various services, such as Google Tag Manager or Google Analytics.</p>



<p>On the post-editing screen, the plugin provides a simple meta box for customizing the meta title and description.  Users can also opt to hide the post from search engines and change the Facebook and Twitter images for the post.  And, that&rsquo;s it.</p>



<img />Per-post SEO options meta box.



<p>Each of these options can be skipped if you prefer to let the plugin handle them automatically.</p>



<p>Suffice it to say, I am a fan of the slimmed-down interface.  The plugin has no SEO scores, keyword rankings, or 20 different options to worry about.  It does not show a preview of what the post might look like in a search engine.  The options available are items that I <em>may</em> want to configure from time to time, so it&rsquo;s nice to have the ability to do so when needed.</p>



<h2>The Downsides of the Plugin</h2>



<p>Slimmed-down does not always equate to being better.  You make sacrifices by allowing the plugin to make decisions that may not always be the best for your site.  Keep these in mind when deciding whether to use the plugin.</p>



<h3>Automatic Redirects</h3>



<p>One of the biggest downsides of automated systems is that I sometimes want things to be handled differently by the plugin.  The plugin&rsquo;s automatic redirect feature is a good example of that issue.  Out of the box, the plugin will redirect all attachment page views to the media file.  It also redirects visitors to author archive pages to the home page if the author has not written any posts or on single-author sites.</p>



<p>These auto-redirects may be desirable for some end-users, but they are not something I want.  The problem is there is no clear way to disable this feature, even via code.</p>



<h3>Header Cleanup</h3>



<p>The plugin also has a &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; feature that automatically removes the RSD link, Windows Live Writer manifest link, WordPress version number, and post shortlink from the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area on the front end.  It may be desirable to remove those items, but their removal would be more appropriate in a cleanup WordPress type of plugin rather than a plugin focused on SEO.</p>



<h3>Automatic Image Alt Attributes</h3>



<p>Slim SEO automatically adds the <code>alt</code> attribute to post thumbnails and when inserting images into the editor.  The problem is that it uses the attachment title.  This could make accessibility worse than simply leaving the alt attribute empty.  If your attachment title is something like <code>DS_IMG9453.jpg</code>, it does not accurately describe an image.</p>



<h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>



<p>The plugin has a shortcode for outputting breadcrumbs.  It must either be manually added to a shortcode-aware area or within a theme template.</p>



<p>The breadcrumbs functionality provides a baseline experience. It doesn&rsquo;t handle every scenario or even close to every scenario.  The feature will not get you far with highly-complex setups.   However, it would work OK for the average install. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s par for the course with SEO plugins &mdash; mediocre breadcrumbs at best.  Frankly, SEO plugins should drop breadcrumbs from the feature list and let fully-fledged breadcrumb plugins do their thing.  Users should use opt for a plugin that specifically focuses on being a breadcrumb plugin.  Authors who build those tend to have more experience handling edge cases.</p>



<h2>How Does the Code Stack Up?</h2>



<p>From a programming perspective, the code is clean and clear.  It is 90% to the point where it should be.  The missing 10% is that there are no references to many of the objects the plugin creates.  This is not an issue limited to this plugin and is more common than it should be.</p>



<p>This issue makes it next to impossible to remove actions and filters from hooks.  For end-users, this does not matter.  For developers, it is not a frustration-free exercise to manipulate how the plugin works.  This could easily be solved in numerous ways, such as using a container, service locator, static single instance, singleton, or even a global.  Whether some of those methods should be deployed is beyond the scope of this review.  Nevertheless, <em>some</em> reference to the plugin&rsquo;s objects would help.</p>



<p>Addressing this issue would come in handy disabling those auto-redirects.</p>



<h2>The Final Verdict</h2>



<p>Aside from a handful of admittedly trivial gripes, I would use this plugin in lieu of SEO plugins with more options.  Years of running multiple sites has taught me to grab for the simplest solutions so that I can get back to doing the things I enjoy doing.</p>



<p>If you prefer to micro-manage every aspect of your SEO, there are plenty of existing options out there.  Slim SEO will not fit your needs.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 20:48:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Click the &ldquo;&Omega;&rdquo; button in the editor to open a modal with a list of characters not found on a standard keyboard.  The user then only needed to click on the character they wanted to insert and go about the business of writing their post.</p>



<p>For users who made the move to the block editor and were accustomed to inserting special characters at the click of a button, life became more complicated.  The answer to their woes was to first insert a Classic block and use its special character inserter, which kind of defeats the purpose of using the new and shiny block editor.  Another option was to use the special character app/program packaged with their computer, which assumes all users know the keyboard shortcut for it or how to run the program.</p>



<p>By many accounts, this would be considered a <em>standard</em> feature for any text editor.  When WordPress is at a stage of trying to sell a new editor, it should be prepared to include features that users of the old editor consider standard.  The lack of a special-character inserter could have been written off as an oversight if people were not asking for it.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1678">Reimplement Character Map</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7162">Just a Few More Text/Paragraph Formatting Choices?</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/8782">Add Special Character Menu</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/8817">Where Are the Special Characters?</a></li></ul>



<p>People <em>were</em> asking for it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the requests caught the attention of the 10up team.  In September this year, they <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/insert-special-characters-wordpress-plugin/">released the first version</a> of their <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-special-characters/">Insert Special Characters</a> plugin.  It has since gone through a couple of updates and works well across browsers.</p>



<p>The plugin is simple and does its job much better than the previous Classic editor inserter.  Instead of just handling the basics, the team went above and beyond what was necessary to launch the plugin.</p>



<p>The plugin adds a new sub-menu item to the text toolbar titled &ldquo;&Omega; Special Characters.&rdquo;</p>



<img />&ldquo;Special Characters&rdquo; rich text menu item.



<p>After clicking the link to insert a special character, a modal box appears on the screen.  The box provides hundreds of special characters to choose from.  It sorts them under Miscellaneous, Math, Latin, and Arrow categories while providing a search filter to narrow down the list.  The box can also be reached by typing <code>ctrl</code>/<code>cmd</code> + <code>o</code> on the keyboard.</p>



<img />Special characters insertion modal box.



<p>Like many modals, the box pops up in a weird position from time to time, depending on where the insertion point is on the screen. Outside of that, I found no major problems with the plugin.</p>



<p>The plugin also <a href="https://github.com/10up/insert-special-characters/blob/1.0.2/README.md#extending">provides a hook</a> for other developers to manipulate the tabs and available characters in the modal.</p>



<p>This does beg the question of whether the feature should be implemented in the core block editor now.  If the core team puts it in at this point, one would hope they would make it competitive with the plugin.  Anything less would be a letdown.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 20:46:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Changes include several accessibility improvements and four security vulnerability fixes.  The update includes multiple changes to the default Twenty Twenty theme.</p>



<p>Version 5.3.1 is a security and maintenance release.  All users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.  For those with auto-updates enabled, updates are currently rolling out.  All major branches of WordPress from version 3.7 through 5.3 received the new security fixes.</p>



<p>The following security issues were addressed:</p>



<ul><li>Users without the correct permission (capability) could make a post sticky via the REST API.</li><li>An issue where cross-site scripting (XSS) could be stored in links.</li><li>Hardening the <code>wp_kses_bad_protocol()</code> function so that it is aware of the named colon attribute.</li><li>A stored XSS vulnerability using block editor content.</li></ul>



<p>Most of the release focused on maintenance.  Form fields and buttons now have the same height, which should result in a more consistent admin UI.  This has long been an issue, but the accessibility changes in WordPress 5.3 highlighted the problem.</p>



<p>A bug with how permalinks were generated with the new Date/Time changes in WordPress 5.3 has been fixed.  This left some sites using date-based URLs with incorrect post permalinks.</p>



<p>Other changes include removing support for the CollegeHumor oEmbed provider (the site is no longer available), updating the <code>sodium_compat</code> library, and making sure admin verification emails use the user&rsquo;s locale instead of the site&rsquo;s locale.  For a full overview of all changes, visit the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-3-1/">WordPress 5.3.1 release page</a>.</p>



<h2>Accessibility Improvements</h2>



<img />&ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; color scheme with new button colors.



<p>Some of the biggest accessibility changes fixed issues with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/12/10/alternate-color-schemes-changes-in-wordpress-5-3-1/">alternate admin color schemes</a> available in WordPress.  The accessibility improvements to buttons in WordPress 5.3 did not get carried over to most of the alternate schemes.  Or, rather, those alternate color schemes were not taken into account when the changes went into effect.  This left secondary button elements practically unreadable in some cases, which made accessibility worse.</p>



<p>Version 5.3.1 creates a unified design for secondary buttons for every color scheme.  It also makes sure that the <code>:active</code> state for buttons are consistent.</p>



<p>Other improvements to accessibility include adding underlines to links on the Dashboard screen that were not clearly links by context, properly disabling nav menu forms when they should not be in use, and adding hover effects for links on the &ldquo;About&rdquo; admin screens.</p>



<h2>Twenty Twenty Changes</h2>



<img />Author bio option in the customizer.



<p>The Twenty Twenty theme launched with JavaScript-based, smooth-scroll behavior for anchor links.  This feature did not work correctly in all cases.  It also broke anchor links to individual comments when paginated comments were enabled on a site.  </p>



<p>Version 1.1 of Twenty Twenty <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/12/08/twenty-twenty-animated-scroll-changes-in-wordpress-5-3-1/">includes CSS-based, smooth-scroll behavior</a>.  This greatly simplifies the code by using native behavior.  It also works based on the user&rsquo;s reduced motion setting for their browser, which enhances accessibility for the theme.</p>



<p>The theme update comes packaged with a new option for showing or hiding the post author bio.  The setting is available under the &ldquo;Theme Options&rdquo; section in the customizer.  It is enabled by default and will show the author bio section at the end of every post across the site.</p>



<p>The Twenty Twenty update also includes several bug fixes, most of which were trivial issues.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:58:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>If you have sites that support automatic background updates, they’ve already started the update process.</p>



<h2>Security updates</h2>



<p>Four security issues affect WordPress versions 5.3 and earlier; version 5.3.1 fixes them, so you’ll want to upgrade. If you haven’t yet updated to 5.3, there are also updated versions of 5.2 and earlier that fix the security issues.</p>

A total of 161 pull requests (patches) were merged into version 7.1 of the plugin.  Over 20 bugs were squashed while the team added several enhancements, which include better multi-block selection, a new welcome modal, and drag-and-drop featured images.</p>



<p>The team refactored several areas of the codebase to prepare for future changes and make it possible to use new hooks.  API changes include a new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17926">custom select control</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18609">text highlight</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17603">custom gradient picker</a> components for developers to use in their plugins.</p>



<p>The release also featured a toolbar button for switching between &ldquo;edit&rdquo; and &ldquo;select&rdquo; mode.  The select mode allows you to select blocks without opening the editing controls unless you click again within a block, which switches you back to editing mode.  The only noticeable difference is that the editing controls do not appear while in select mode.  <em>Wondering when I will ever use this feature&hellip;</em></p>



<h2>Welcome Guide Modal</h2>



<img />New welcome guide modal for first-time users.



<p>The new version of the plugin includes a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18041">pop-up welcome modal</a> for first-time users.  There are currently three panels with short introductions to what blocks are, how to use them, and getting to know the block library.  </p>



<p>Ideally, the modal will link out to more extensive documentation in a future iteration.  Right now, the information provided does not go into much detail.  It feels like a message to say, &ldquo;Hey, check out this shiny new thing.&rdquo;  However, there needs to be more substance for it to be helpful for first-timers.</p>



<h2>Improved Multi-block Selection</h2>



<img />Selecting multiple blocks at once.



<p>The block editor now incorporates a nicer <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16835">native multi-block selection</a> process.  The first aspect of this change is to use the native selection color, which improves accessibility.  It also uses native selection behavior when selecting multiple blocks.</p>



<p>The second part is important because it paves the way toward partial block selection in a future release.  Currently, when selecting text across multiple blocks, the editor extends this out to select all text from the selected blocks.  In the future, it should be possible to select only part of the text across multiple blocks.  This would be consistent with normal text-based editors where users can select the last sentence from one paragraph and the first from the next, for example.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18746">Selecting multiple blocks and pasting</a> new content works correctly in 7.1.  In the past, the rich text component handled pasting.  This resulted in the blocks being split and the pasted content inserted between the split.  The block editor now handles the pasting process.  This allows users to completely replace multiple selected blocks with a paste.</p>



<h2>Drag-and-Drop Featured Images</h2>



<img />Dragging a featured image from the desktop.



<p>Instead of clicking the featured image box to open the media modal, users can now save themselves a click.  Just like dragging and dropping an image into the editor, the featured image box now accepts any image file dropped into it.</p>



<h2>Table Captions</h2>



<img />Adding a caption to the table block.



<p>For those who have long waited for a true table <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> implementation, keep on waiting.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/11589">year-old ticket</a> that was opened for a table caption feature was closed with a solution matching that of other blocks with captions (e.g., image, gallery).  The <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15554">pull request</a> featured a lengthy discussion over the technical limitations of how to best handle the feature.  Ultimately, the decision was to wrap tables in a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element and add the caption via the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag.</p>



<p>While this may work for some who need to add a caption or summary below a table, it is not currently helping users who need captions in their normal spot at the top of a table.</p>



<p>In the long run, users who need to roll out advanced tables will likely need a table block plugin anyway.  The Gutenberg and core WordPress implementation is limiting for anything beyond the most basic table output.  Real captions would have been a nice touch though.</p>



<h2>Alignment for the Navigation Block</h2>



<img />Aligning navigation block items.



<p>The Navigation block, which moved out of the experimental stage in version 7.0, has a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18909">new option for justifying</a> the list items to the left, right, or center.  This will be an important feature for full-site editing in the long term because users will want to set their nav menu perfectly.</p>



<p>This block will likely be in flux for a while.  There are still major questions about how navigation will work on mobile, especially as we inch closer to full-site editing.  <em>Will core play a role in making mobile menus?  Will themes be left to their own devices?  Will themes offer multiple options based on screen size?</em></p>



<h2>Moving Ahead with Templates and Full-Site Editing</h2>



<p>Coming off the heels of a somewhat controversial <a href="https://wptavern.com/initial-documentation-for-block-based-wordpress-themes-proposed">documentation proposal for block-based themes</a>, version 7.1 includes a new demo block template named <code>index.html</code>.  It is a fallback template in cases where no templates are available.  This is an early, experimental step toward making full-site editing a reality.  </p>



<p>Theme developers who want to start looking at what block templates <em>could</em> look like, should <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/v7.1.0/lib/demo-block-templates/index.html">view the demo index.html template</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the release ZIP file available through the official plugin repository does not include the <code>index.html</code> template.  It was excluded because of a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/19066">bug in the build process</a>.  However, it may be packaged in a version 7.1.1 minor release.  The file is correctly included for developers who clone from the Git repository.</p>



<p>The second step of this process was the addition of a Template Part block.  The idea for this block is that it would be a placeholder to add to templates, which would output a template part on the front end.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:21:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Jeffrey Carandang, the creator behind the EditorsKit WordPress plugin, <a href="https://shareablock.com/introducing-shareablock-share-and-download-free-gutenberg-block-template-designs/">launched a new community site</a> for sharing block designs and templates today.  The ShareABlock website allows visitors to download block files directly from the site and import them into the block editor.  Users can also sign up to share custom block designs and full-blown block templates.  All downloads are available for free.</p>



<p>At the moment, there are 18 block designs available for download.  There are two primary types of downloads:  block patterns and block templates. </p>



<p><a href="https://shareablock.com/blocks/category/block-patterns/">Patterns</a> are smaller groupings of blocks to create a specific section for a page.  These include designs such as various hero sections, pricing lists, and a call-to-action section. </p>



<p><a href="https://shareablock.com/blocks/category/templates/">Templates</a> work the same way as patterns.  However, they are larger sets of blocks designed to create an entire page.  For example, one template allows users to import a full gallery portfolio page.  Another creates an editable resume layout.</p>



<p>Other than Carandang, two other contributors have shared block designs.  This number should rise as more people sign up and decide to share their creations.  The <a href="https://shareablock.com/how-to-submit-design-on-share-a-block/">registration process</a> is open to anyone who wants to join.  However, each contribution is subject to a review for quality assurance.</p>



<p>&ldquo;One of my primary goals in creating [EditorsKit] is to help users get a little more comfortable with using the new WordPress Gutenberg block editor,&rdquo; described Carandang in the announcement post for ShareABlock.  &ldquo;The goal is to help users create Gutenberg blocks easily. With drag and drop import, layout and designs will be available in an instant.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Carandang feels confident that pre-configured block designs will help users learn how to use the block editor to create richer content.  &ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s just a little help to make them comfortable with Gutenberg, it means a lot,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>



<p>He said the feedback from users has been positive thus far.</p>



<img />Importing the Fullscreen Profile Card block pattern.



<p>Block designs downloaded from ShareABlock require the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/">EditorsKit plugin</a>, which is available for free in the WordPress plugin directory.  This requirement is because WordPress does not currently have a native importer built into the block editor.  In the future, this may change and the requirement could be lifted.</p>



<p>Version 1.7 of EditorsKit introduced the <a href="https://wptavern.com/editorskit-1-6-and-1-7-add-tools-for-writers-drag-and-drop-block-export-import">ability to import blocks</a> by dragging and dropping a block <code>.json</code> file into the editor.  The blocks available via ShareABlock work using this feature.  After downloading a <code>.json</code> file from the site, users merely need to drag it into the editor.  Users can also use the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; block available from EditorsKit to do the same.</p>



<h2>Block Patterns and the Future</h2>



<p>&ldquo;The plan is to provide integration with Block Patterns, which is what the core devs are currently working on,&rdquo; said Carandang.  &ldquo;With this integration, the import process will be much easier.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Block patterns are a planned feature that is under <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/17335">active development</a> in the Gutenberg plugin and will eventually make its way into core WordPress. Patterns are predefined sets of blocks.  They will allow users to quickly create more advanced layouts while also teaching what specific blocks do.  The idea is to have a set of patterns with common layouts that people see around the web.  </p>



<p>Carandang said he is actively checking the progress of the Block Patterns feature.  He is eager to see the feature to come to fruition, which carries with it the possibility of more widespread use of the blocks available from his new community.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 19:51:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The focus for WordPress over the past year has been on nine primary projects.  Of the nine projects, WordPress only managed to ship two in 2019.  This means that the focus in 2020 will be much the same as the community continues building on the progress it has made toward the existing projects.</p>



<p>Currently, there are three <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/">planned major releases</a> for WordPress in 2020:</p>



<ul><li>Version 5.4 &ndash; March 2020</li><li>Version 5.5 &ndash; August 2020</li><li>Version 5.6 &ndash; December 2020</li></ul>



<p>Each of those dates are subject to change.  We should also get more specific dates as each release draws near.  The various projects for 2020 should land in each release.</p>



<p>Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress, initially laid out the 2019 plans in his <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2018-wordpress-embraces-the-block-editor">2018 State of the Word</a> address and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/">listed the projects</a> on the Make Core blog.  The big takeaway is that 2019 was supposed to be the year that we got closer to full-site customization (Phase 2 of the Gutenberg project).  While developers have made huge strides in making that a reality, much of the project is still in its infancy.</p>



<h2>Projects That Shipped in 2019</h2>



<p>All existing core WordPress widgets now exist as blocks.  Rather than being limited to placing widgets where the theme decides, users can now put widgets in posts, pages, or any other content area via the block editor.  As the project continues to move toward full-site editing, users will eventually have the ability to place these widgets and other blocks nearly anywhere.</p>



<p>The site health project was merged into core.  It features a screen that provides information about the site&rsquo;s health to site owners.  It also has a fatal-error detection script that emails site owners when plugin and theme issues are found.</p>



<h2>Projects to Expect in 2020</h2>



<p>Most of the remaining projects that did not quite make the cut for release in 2019 have still made progress during the year.  The following is a breakdown of what projects to expect in the coming year.</p>



<h3>Navigation Menu Block</h3>



<img />Navigation block in the block editor.



<p>Currently, the navigation block&rsquo;s target is to ship with WordPress 5.4.  This is a likely reality because it is now out of the experimental stage and is available for beta testing in <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-0-launches-stable-navigation-block-post-blocks-and-template-parts">Gutenberg 7.0</a>.  The development team worked on this block for several releases and now have something stable enough for user testing.</p>



<p>This block is a major piece of the site-customization puzzle.  In the long term, users will need an easy-to-use block for handling navigation menus across their site.</p>



<h3>Custom Block-Aware Content Areas for Themes</h3>



<p>Phase 1 of the Gutenberg project brought the block editor to post content.  A large part of Phase 2 is <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13489">breaking outside of post content</a> and allowing users to add blocks in more areas.  It is unclear exactly what that will look like in the long run.  Themes should be able to register additional block-aware areas.</p>



<p>The target release for this feature is set to WordPress 5.5, but it is too early to guess whether that is a realistic target.  It is a tough issue to solve because it will need to coincide with decisions on <a href="https://wptavern.com/initial-documentation-for-block-based-wordpress-themes-proposed">theme block templates</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18029">saving multiple entities</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13113">full-site customization</a> in general.  It is not a feature that can be rushed because it will have far-reaching consequences to how WordPress works for years into the future.</p>



<h3>Widget Areas to Support Blocks</h3>



<img />Experimental widget areas feature in Gutenberg.



<p>The current plan is to allow widget areas (sidebars) to support blocks alongside widgets.  The Gutenberg plugin has an experimental widget areas option for enabling an early version of this feature, which has a target release of WordPress 5.5.</p>



<p>There are two aspects to making this feature a reality.  The first is making it work on the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13204">widgets admin screen</a>.  The second is making it work in the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13205">customizer</a>, an area where users can also manage widgets.</p>



<p>At the moment, it feels like the sidebar concept should be deprecated.  The experimental feature works by allowing users to add blocks to a sidebar, which are converted into one big &ldquo;block area&rdquo; widget on output.  If WordPress is &ldquo;all in&rdquo; on the block paradigm, energy would be better spent focusing on allowing themes to build custom block areas and letting the official Sidebar API die a slow death.  Mixing an old concept with a new one feels clunky at best.  It&rsquo;s time to move on and soft-deprecate sidebars and widgets until most themes no longer support them.</p>



<h3>Block Directory Search and Install</h3>



<img />Experimental block directory search in Gutenberg plugin.



<p>Eventually, all WordPress users will be able to search for a block via the block inserter.  If the block exists, they can insert it into the block area.  If not, the inserter will allow users to discover new blocks from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/">block directory</a>.  The installation, activation, and insertion of the new block should be seamless.</p>



<p>The target release for this feature is set for WordPress 5.5, which should be possible (if not earlier) based on how well the feature currently works in the Gutenberg plugin.  It is not perfect yet and has broken more than a few of my posts when working with installed blocks.  There are still <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/17440">several open issues</a> that need to be addressed.</p>



<p>Plugin authors who are looking to get ahead of the game can submit block plugins by following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/12/06/block-directory-plugin-guidelines/">block plugin guidelines</a>.</p>



<h3>Automatic Plugin, Theme, and Major Core Updates</h3>



<p>After years of extensive testing and using automatic updates for minor WordPress releases, it feels like we should already have auto-updates on everything at this point.  Having to keep up with plugin and theme updates can be a pain for some site owners.  With enough plugins, it is not out of the realm of possibility to have one or more plugins to update daily.</p>



<p>Some hosting solutions and Jetpack have mitigated this issue for many users by offering automatic plugin updates, but this is a long overdue core feature that should be a high priority.  No target release was given for auto-updates on themes/plugins or major core releases.  Let&rsquo;s hope the feature does not get put on the back burner for another year.</p>



<h3>Tackling Over 6,500 Trac Issues</h3>



<p>With the Gutenberg plugin getting much of the attention these days, it is easy to forget that there are <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">thousands of tickets</a> awaiting patches, reviews, and decisions on Trac.  I have long been a champion of using one major release of WordPress to simply fix existing bugs while adding no new features.</p>



<p>Jonathan Desrosiers has written an <a href="https://jonathandesrosiers.com/2019/06/wordpress-triage-team-3-month-reflection/">extensive post</a> that covers much of the work the Triage Team has done earlier this year.</p>



<p>Triaging is not something that ever truly reaches a conclusion.  It is an ongoing process that must continue throughout the life of a project.  People who are interested in being involved with the Triage Team can find more information on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/01/introducing-the-wordpress-triage-team/">Triage Team announcement post</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 21:25:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:11:"

<p>I recently took part in DoSummitGood, an online conference for people and organizations working to Do Good in the WordPress community.</p>



<p>The organizers managed to get recordings of all the talks on YouTube the very next day, which is pretty impressive.</p>



<p>In this talk I tell a lot more about what was going on in my personal life while spinning up HeroPress, so I recommend checking it out even if you&#8217;ve already heard the story.</p>

<h2><strong>Meet Jill Binder</strong></h2>



<p>Jill Binder never meant to become an activist. She insists it was an accident.</p>



<p>Despite that, Jill has led the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training working group in the WordPress Community team since 2017. This group is dedicated to increasing the number of women and other underrepresented groups who are stepping up to become speakers at WordPress Meetups, WordCamps, and events.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jill’s back story</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Internship</strong></h3>



<p>Jill’s WordPress story begins in 2011, in Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;Jill secured an internship for her college program, working on a higher education website that was built in WordPress.&nbsp;As a thank you, her practicum advisor bought Jill a ticket to WordCamp Vancouver 2011: Developer’s Edition. After that Jill began freelancing&nbsp; with WordPress as a Solopreneur.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>First steps in the WordPress community</strong></h3>



<p>The following year her internship advisor, who had become a client, was creating the first ever BuddyCamp for BuddyPress. He asked Jill to be on his organizing team. At that event she also moderated a panel that had Matt Mullenweg on it. Then, Jill was invited to be on the core organizing team for WordCamp Vancouver.</p>



<p>Part of this role meant reviewing and selecting speakers. From 40 speaker applications that could be a fit the team had to pick only 14 to speak.</p>



<h2><strong>The diversity challenge when selecting speakers</strong></h2>



<p>For anyone who has organized a conference, you know that speaker selection is hard. Of the 40 applications, 7 were from women, and the lead organizer selected 6 of those to be included in the speaker line up.</p>



<p>At this point Jill wasn’t aware that very few women apply to speak at tech conferences and suggested selection should be made on the best fit for the conference. The team shared that not only did they feel the pitches were good and fit the conference, but they also needed to be accepted or the Organizers would be criticized for a lack of diversity.</p>



<p>Selecting women for fear of criticism is embarrassing to admit, but that’s how people felt in 2013.</p>



<p>By the time the event happened, though, the number of women speakers dropped to 4. And with an additional track being added, the number of speakers overall was up to 28. Only 1 speaker in 7 was a woman (or 14%) and attendees did ask questions and even blogged about the lack of representation.</p>



<h2><strong>What keeps women from applying?</strong></h2>



<p>Later that year at&nbsp; WordCamp San Francisco—the biggest WordCamp at the time (before there was a WordCamp US)—Jill took the opportunity to chat with other organizers about her experience. She found out that many organizers had trouble getting enough women to present.</p>



<p>Surprisingly Vancouver had a high number of women applicants in comparison to others, and the consensus was more would be accepted&nbsp; if only more would apply.</p>



<p>Jill decided that she&nbsp; needed to know why this was happening? Why weren’t there more women applying? She started researching, reading, and talking to people.</p>



<p>Though this issue is complex, two things came up over and over:</p>



<ul><li>“What would I talk about?”</li><li>“I’m not an expert on anything. I don’t know enough about anything to give a talk on it.”</li></ul>



<h2><strong>A first workshop with encouraging results</strong></h2>



<p>Then Jill had an idea. She brought up the issue at an event and someone suggested that they should get women together in a room and brainstorm speaker topics.</p>



<p>So Jill became the lead of a small group creating a workshop in Vancouver: the talented Vanessa Chu, Kate Moore Hermes, and Mandi Wise. In one of the exercises that they created, participants were invited to brainstorm ideas—this proved that they had literally a hundred topic ideas and the biggest problem then became picking just one!</p>



<p>In the first workshop, they focussed on:</p>



<ul><li>Why it matters that women (<em>added later: diverse groups</em>) are in the front of the room</li><li>The myths of what it takes to be the speaker at the front of the room (aka beating impostor syndrome)</li><li>Different presentation formats, especially story-telling</li><li>Finding and refining a topic</li><li>Tips to become a better speaker</li><li>Leveling up by speaking in front of the group throughout the afternoon</li></ul>



<img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-2.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="women gathering to discussion presentation topics" class="wp-image-8195" />Vancouver Workshop 2014



<h2><strong>Leading to workshops across North America and then the world</strong></h2>



<p>Other cities across North America heard about the workshop and started hosting them, adding their own material.</p>



<p>Many women who initially joined her workshop wanted help getting even better at public speaking. So Jill&#8217;s Vancouver team added in some material created from the other cities and a bit more of their own. Such as:</p>



<ul><li>Coming up with a great title</li><li>Writing a pitch that is more likely to get accepted</li><li>Writing a bio</li><li>Creating an outline</li></ul>



<p>At WordCamp Vancouver 2014—only one year since Jill started—there were 50% women speakers and 3 times the number of women applicants! Not only that, but this WordCamp was a Developer’s Edition, where it’s more challenging to find women developers in general, let alone those who will step up to speak.</p>



<h3><strong>More work is needed!</strong></h3>



<p>Impressive as those results were, the reason Jill is so passionate about this work is because of what happened next:</p>



<ul><li>Some of the women who attended the workshop stepped up to be leaders in the community and created new content for other women.</li><li>A handful of others became WordCamp organizers. One year Vancouver had an almost all-female organizing team – 5 out of 6!</li><li>It also influenced local businesses. One local business owner loved what one of the women speakers said so much that he hired her immediately. She was the first woman developer on the team, and soon after she became the Senior Developer.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Diversity touches on many levels</strong></h2>



<p>Jill has seen time and again what happens when different people speak at the front of the room. More people feel welcome in the community. The speakers and the new community members bring new ideas and new passions that help to make the technology we are creating more inclusive. And together we generate new ideas that benefit everyone.</p>



<p>This workshop was so successful, with typical results of going from 10% to 40-60% women speakers at WordCamps, that the WordPress Global Community Team asked Jill to promote it and train it for women and all diverse groups around the world. In late 2017, Jill started leading the Diverse Speaker Training group (<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/">#wpdiversity</a>).</p>



<p>Dozens of community members across the world have now been trained to lead the workshop. With now dozens of workshops worldwide, for WordPress and other open source software projects as well, there is an increase in speaker diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of the success, Jill is now sponsored to continue the program. The first sponsor is Automattic. She’s proud of how the diversity represented on the stage adds value not only to the brand but also in the long-term will lead to the creation of a better product. She’s inspired by seeing the communities change as a result of the new voices and new ideas at the WordPress events.</p>

<p>The team behind Zero BS CRM <a href="https://zerobscrm.com/road-to-v3/">launched version 3.0</a> of their WordPress plugin today.  This is the first major release since the plugin was <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-zero-bs-crm-considers-rebranding-it-as-jetpack-crm">acquired by Automattic in August</a>.  The updated plugin uses custom database tables, opens the plugin for more extensions, and has a more consistent UI than previous versions.</p>



<p>CRM is an acronym for &ldquo;customer relationship management.&rdquo;  CRM systems allow businesses to manage their customer relationships through an interface.  How CRM systems work can vary greatly, depending on the software used.  In general, the goal is to help manage contacts, sales, and productivity.</p>



<p>Zero BS CRM was co-created by Mike Stott and Woody Hayday.  Despite a low number of plugin users (around 1,000 at acquisition), Automattic acquired the plugin based on the strength of the product.  Currently, Stott and Hayday are the primary developers on the plugin and maintain more than 30 commercial extensions for it.</p>



<p>Many CRM solutions are SaaS products, such as Salesforce CRM and HubSpot CRM.  &ldquo;The main benefit of ZBS CRM over online SaaS type solutions is it sits in your WP admin dashboard, and you own your own data,&rdquo; said Stott.</p>



<p>Version 3.0 of the plugin improves in several key areas.  One major change is the switch to custom database tables rather than pigeon-holing everything into a custom post type.  This change should speed up accessing data such as contacts and transactions in large databases.</p>



<p>Users should benefit from a much improved and consistent UI from previous versions.  Zero BS CRM does not strictly follow the core WordPress admin UI.  &ldquo;When looking at ZBS CRM and how to tie in all our menu items into the WordPress UI &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t easy,&rdquo; said Stott.  &ldquo;We settled on using a UI framework with our own top menu, and a natural follow-on for that was to draw our list views using that same UI and button systems. Whether we move this back or not depends on feedback from our users &mdash; we get a lot of positive feedback on how easy it is to navigate around and wouldn&rsquo;t want to change something that&rsquo;s been getting good feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moving to custom tables over custom post types has also helped improve elements of the UI.  Stott said a huge advantage is not having third-party plugins accidentally adding themselves to the plugin&rsquo;s admin pages, such as having unnecessary SEO options on contact records.</p>



<p>Another big change in 3.0 was building out a more extendable foundation for the plugin.  This will open up custom CRM objects in the future.  For example, plugin users could manage resources such as &ldquo;properties&rdquo; or &ldquo;campuses&rdquo; along with customer contact data.  This update creates more potential for industry-specific extensions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It really opens the door for more extendibility in the future,&rdquo; said Stott, &ldquo;and through an improved API in 2020 will allow for us to do more work across platforms and open up our CRM tools to more people.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Zero BS CRM plugin remains free and is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-bs-crm/">available in the WordPress plugin repository</a>.  The primary source of income comes from its extension bundles, which are priced monthly and billed yearly.  The website currently offers freelancer ($11/month), entrepreneur ($17/month), and elite ($30/month) pricing options.  It also has a reseller plan available.</p>



<h2>The Move to Automattic</h2>



<p>When the plugin was first acquired, there was an initial idea to rebrand as &ldquo;Jetpack CRM.&rdquo;  However, they have maintained the Zero BS CRM branding with an acronym instead of the direct expletive for &ldquo;BS.&rdquo;  A rebrand may still be on the table in 2020 or beyond.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been gathering user feedback and sentiment following the minor changes to ZBS CRM and the initial reactions if we were to rename as Jetpack CRM,&rdquo; said Stott.  &ldquo;Since the shorter name, there&rsquo;s been less objection or negative feelings, which puts less pressure on a big rebrand project, but it&rsquo;s certainly something we&rsquo;ll be coming back to.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Stott said the primary focus since the acquisition has been less on branding and more on delivering 3.0 to the existing customer base.</p>



<p>The acquisition by Automattic has helped with how their two-person team works.  &ldquo;The main thing is being able to lean on the amazing team and people throughout Automattic,&rdquo; said Stott.  &ldquo;In the past, we&rsquo;d only have Woody and my input, now we can reach out to experts in design, marketing, plus much more, and bounce our ideas around a vast pool of experience.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He explained that the additional support resources of Automattic&rsquo;s Happiness Engineers means that he and his partner can focus more on engineering and growing the product and team.</p>



<p>The acquisition of Zero BS CRM came during a busy year for Automattic.  With major moves such as <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress">acquiring Tumblr</a> and the <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-raises-300m-in-series-d-investment-round-valuation-jumps-to-3-billion">Salesforce investment</a>, this small plugin has mostly flown under the radar in comparison.  Stott and Hayday have big plans for 2020.  They would like to grow the engineering team and explore bringing their tools to more WordPress.com users.</p>



<p>The plugin&rsquo;s growth has remained stable since the acquisition, according to Stott.  &ldquo;The announcement brought us some additional customers who saw the backing from Automattic as strong advocacy for the plugin over other solutions in the WordPress space, so they made the decision to join us,&rdquo; he said.  The plugin has doubled its active install count and now serves over 2,000 users.  The team expects to continue growing in the coming months.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Dec 2019 20:43:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Love it or hate it, Gutenberg is here to stay.  If you had asked my thoughts on it last December, I would have probably sided with a large portion of other WordPress users.</p>



<p><em>What are you doing?</em></p>



<p><em>WordPress is fine, leave it alone!</em></p>



<p><em>Stop forcing me to use this!</em></p>



<p>Here we are, twelve months later, and you know what? I LOVE IT.  And, I am not alone.</p>



<p>When it comes to writing content, I cannot <em>imagine</em> using the Classic Editor anymore. Sure, for a few paragraphs, the Classic Editor is fine.  However, when you need to make a 4,000+ word post, Gutenberg and the new block system make things a lot easier.</p>



<p>Yes, the UI is a struggle for someone brand new to WordPress.  We have all heard the &ldquo;<em>Wait, I thought you said this was like Word?</em>&rdquo; line.  A good onboarding process would tackle that going forward.  For the rest of us, if you have not adopted Gutenberg yet, you should take another look at it.</p>



<h2>The Need for a New Editor</h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.  The Classic Editor was great for short posts, a couple of headlines and paragraphs, job done.  But, how often were you going into the Text tab to remove an extra line break, fix a shortcode, or cut and paste a section to somewhere else in the post?&nbsp; At best, it was a struggle.  Often, it was excruciating to get your post <em>just right</em> before publishing.</p>



<p>Not only will I <em>not</em> miss this, but I am pleased that new users will not be exposed to it anymore either.</p>



<img />Classic Editor &ndash; Text tab in action



<p>When I first heard of Gutenberg &mdash; before it was released in WordPress 5.0 &mdash; I installed the plugin and was immediately confused and slightly bewildered at the options. I wondered how I would edit in the future. </p>



<p>I, among many others, probably gave out the same noises as when Facebook and Twitter reveal a huge overhaul of their UI, agreeing with everyone that things would never be the same again. <em>This was a mistake. </em>Of course, I was both right and wrong at the same time.  I just didn&rsquo;t know it.  Editing would not be the same again.  Instead, it would be a lot better (with some adjustment).</p>



<p>I also know that many people will not agree with me and do not like the way Gutenberg looks or behaves to this day. But, if you give it some time and understand how it can make your life easier, it will do just that.</p>



<p>First, take the time to work out the difference between Blocks and Document. On the left you have all the blocks for your post or page, inserting them in merrily as you go. On the right, the Document panel controls everything else, handily changing when you need to fine-tune a block.</p>



<img />Gutenberg block editor in action



<p>One of the most common complaints I have read is people struggling with the toolbar that appears as you hover over each block. There is a simple solution to this, and when it is enabled, the majority of people suddenly start to love it! Make sure you set the view to &ldquo;Top Toolbar&rdquo; in the Gutenberg options. Now you have a distraction and clutter-free editing environment to work with.</p>



<h2>Gutenberg vs. Page Builders</h2>



<p>Gutenberg is not a page builder, and it is a common argument thrown out by people on why they refuse to use it. They are right, it is not a replacement for the likes of Elementor or Beaver Builder.  If you remove the comparison to page builders from your mind, you will find adapting to it is much easier.</p>



<p>My peers and I regularly chat about Gutenberg and agree it is already great for writing.  The post creation process is a breath of fresh air.  Others have great stories from their clients about being able to produce content and edit it with ease, and the number of editor-related support requests is down, which can only be a good thing.</p>



<p>However, many of us would not use it for designing pages. Instead, we still prefer to use one of the many page builders for that complete control.</p>



<p>Gutenberg Phase 2 will allow editing of the site to areas outside of the main content (e.g., headers, footers, sidebars) and will creep further into the page builder category, which means we will have a strange blend of Gutenberg and page builders living side by side on many sites soon.</p>



<p>Will it remove the complete need for themes? Who knows? I suspect we will have people further divided into opposing camps going forward, but what a great opportunity for us to collectively work on for a better overall experience in the end.</p>



<h2>By the Numbers</h2>



<p>Let us take a quick look at Gutenberg and its penetration to date.</p>



<p>Currently, 63.8% of all WordPress installs are running 5.x onward according to WordPress.org, which means Gutenberg is available natively on nearly two-thirds of all WordPress installs.</p>



<p>But, it is not all red roses when it comes to adoption. </p>



<p>The Classic Editor plugin has over 5 million active installs (and a rather biased 723 five-star reviews, such as &ldquo;Keep this forever&rdquo; and &ldquo;Never going to give it up!&rdquo;). It is also currently in the top five of the most popular plugins. </p>



<p>Is this the backlash against Gutenberg or incompatibility with older themes forcing users to use the Classic Editor for now? At a guess, a good majority is probably the latter combined with some diehards. </p>



<p>But, look at the graph below from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/" target="_blank">Classic Editor plugin page</a>.</p>



<img />



<p>Growth is declining. That is not a movement of people who continue to install Classic Editor on new installs and refuse to adapt.</p>



<p>Classic Editor adoption will likely continue falling, and perhaps the original date of it being supported until 2022 isn&rsquo;t that far-fetched after all (note: they have said they will continue to support it longer if needed).</p>



<p>On the flip-side, the Gutenberg plugin has 200,000 active installs and a whopping two-thirds of reviews (2,003) are a paltry one star. However, many are merely unhelpful complaints (e.g., &ldquo;This is junk&rdquo; and &ldquo;Destroy it&rdquo;).  They do not tell the true story to novices.</p>



<p>As you can see from the graph below for the Gutenberg plugin, active install growth is up and continues to climb.  It is not at the same pace as the decline with the Classic Editor, but that is probably because it is bundled with WordPress now.</p>



<img />



<p>One thing people seem to forget is Gutenberg is a plugin in and of itself.  It is updated frequently, whereas the majority of users only see changes to it when there is a WordPress core update.</p>



<p>If you can see past the fields of one-star reviews and install the plugin, you will be rewarded with more frequent updates to the experience. </p>



<p>For example, version 7.0 recently added in the Navigation block as stable, allowing users to quickly create a menu of links. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; this does require theme integration for it to work, but you can get a better idea of where it is heading on a more frequent basis this way (7.0 is expected to ship with WordPress 5.4 in March/April 2020).</p>



<h2>Block Party</h2>



<p>Compatibility with Gutenberg continues at a quick pace.  With over 21 pages of block-enabled plugins available on WordPress.org, pretty much all the popular plugins have solutions in place.  A fair amount of plugin updates these days are also adding new and enhanced blocks as standard.</p>



<p>If those are not enough for you, we also now have a new breed of block-specific plugins. There is a growing trend of plugins devoted to purely enhancing the style and number of blocks you can add to your site.</p>



<p>Popular Gutenberg-focused plugins such as <a class="ek-link" href="https://wpstackable.com">Stackable</a> and <a class="ek-link" href="https://editorskit.com">EditorsKit</a> add further styling and editing abilities, bringing you another step closer to full-page design and enhancing your content.</p>



<img />EditorsKit &ndash; a purely Gutenberg plugin.



<p>Because no one knows how far Gutenberg will go and which toes it will step on, block plugins may have a fight on their hands in the future.  At the pace they are being released and updated, it is a good sign of a committed global collective who not only believe in the future of blocks but is excited about it too.</p>



<h2>What Does the Future Hold?</h2>



<p>Gutenberg is here to stay, and I don&rsquo;t think any of us have ever denied that. It is probably not an issue for anyone who started using WordPress for the first time this year.</p>



<p>Thankfully, for those already deeply embedded in WordPress, things are getting easier (and I would say more enjoyable) with the growth of the new Gutenberg-specific plugins.</p>



<p>With the advent of platforms such as Wix and Squarespace, it was obvious that WordPress needed <em>something</em> to make it more user-friendly and Gutenberg is a solid attempt at that. It is still a bit rough around the edges, but the days we look back nostalgically at the Classic Editor are likely numbered.</p>



<p>How will it look at the end of 2020? Will you still be using the Classic Editor?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:49:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Chris Hughes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

While the document is merely a starting point for the conversation, it is a set of ideas that will likely forever reshape the WordPress landscape.  It is paradigm-shifting.</p>



<p>For the first time, theme authors can glimpse what their future holds.  Since the inception of Gutenberg, many have asked for more technical details.  Particularly, they wanted to know whether themes would be reduced to a stylesheet or a stylesheet and a few PHP files.  <em>What would themes look like architecturally?  Would themes exist at all?</em></p>



<p>The document, while open for changes, makes a strong case about the structure of themes going forward.  It is clear that much forethought has gone into the proposal.  It matches the direction of the experimental site-editing feature in Gutenberg that has already been set in motion.  Even though it is subject to change, there seems to be a finality to the overarching idea.  The writing has long been on the wall.  Now everyone can see the wall.  The missing piece is figuring out how to bring the idea to fruition.</p>



<h2>What is Full Site Editing?</h2>



<p>Before understanding how themes of the future might work, you must first understand the direction that Gutenberg is headed.  The end goal for Gutenberg, and eventually WordPress, is for users to have the ability to customize every aspect of their site via the block system.  Currently, the block system primarily handles editing post content.</p>



<p>To move to full-site editing, every piece of dynamic data about a site must be a block.  For example, a site title block must exist as a placeholder for the site title.  Users should be able to place it anywhere they desire to output the title, such as in the header.</p>



<p>This has left theme authors with a reasonable question:  If users can move these blocks anywhere, where do themes fit into the picture?</p>



<p>It is easy to see how themes would become little more than a stylesheet that styles every WordPress block while also handling other necessary styles like typography and vertical rhythm.  Even then, it makes one wonder if themes, at least in how we have come to know them, are necessary at all.</p>



<h2>The Proposed Theme Structure</h2>



<p>The proposed structure does not look much different from current WordPress themes.  The big difference is that theme templates would become &ldquo;block templates&rdquo; and &ldquo;block template parts.&rdquo;  These templates would be HTML files rather than PHP files.</p>



<p>The following is where the structure currently stands.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>theme
|__ style.css
|__ functions.php
|__ block-templates
    |__ index.html
    |__ single.html
    |__ archive.html
    |__ ...
|__ block-template-parts
    |__ header.html
    |__ footer.html
    |__ sidebar.html
    |__ ...</code></pre>



<p>From a templating perspective, it appears relatively <em>normal</em> for a WordPress theme.  The files simply have a different type and are organized in specific folders.</p>



<p>However, the difference is how the HTML templates would work.  They would essentially become placeholders for blocks.  Users would also have the ability to edit or completely overwrite individual templates via the WordPress admin.  Because templates are made up of blocks, no code would be necessary on the user&rsquo;s part.  They could simply point and click to insert or remove blocks with their mouse.  </p>



<p>In other words, block templates within themes would be unique starting points for users to build their sites.</p>



<p>There are two noteworthy items about the proposed system:  themes are still themes and end-users can become theme builders.</p>



<h3>The Essence of a Theme Remains the Same</h3>



<p>When you cut through everything else, WordPress themes have always been HTML and CSS.  The PHP aspect of theming basically mixes PHP function calls (i.e., template tags) within some structured HTML markup.  If you look at most themes going through the official WordPress theme directory, you will find that the underlying markup is mostly the same.</p>



<p>In the block template system, this idea doesn&rsquo;t change.  If anything, it could simplify the role of theme author by creating a set of standard elements (blocks) that themes output.  If done right, it also creates a standard for class names so that styles can easily be shared across themes and all sorts of similar goodies.</p>



<h3>Anyone Can Build a Theme</h3>



<p>The initial outline explains the potential of exporting themes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Ultimately, any WordPress user with the correct capabilities (example: administrator WordPress role) will be able to access these templates in the WordPress admin, edit them in dedicated views and potentially export the templates as a theme.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is where the proposed system could revolutionize website building.  Those without the coding skills to create a WordPress theme today could have the tools to contribute something back tomorrow.</p>



<p>The idea aligns perfectly with the open-source ethos of WordPress.  By giving everyone the ability to export their customizations, it provides an avenue for contributing that we have never had before for non-coders.  <em>A free directory of customized themes created by and for the community, anyone?</em></p>



<h2>The Design Side of the Equation</h2>



<p>Block templates are merely the HTML.  Themes will need to stand apart with their CSS.  However, there must be standardization to pull this off.</p>



<p>Designers will need to shift to a block-based approach when it comes to design.  Some may already be familiar with various &ldquo;component-based&rdquo; systems, which would work much the same way.  Rather than designing from the top-down, theme authors would approach design on a more atomic level by designing each block.</p>



<p>There are also many unanswered questions about how styles will eventually work.  Currently, there is an open ticket for <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9534">discussing a style system for blocks</a>.  Much of the discussion is around how to integrate a design system with themes.</p>



<h2>Join the Discussion</h2>



<p>It is important to point out that nothing about this proposal is set in stone.  It is a high-level outline of what the future of themes could hold.  However, now is time for input from the community, especially theme authors who may have felt a bit out of the loop in the past.  Now is the time to make your voice heard and to contribute ideas to the discussion.</p>



<p>The WordPress theme review team also has an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/12/04/questions-about-the-future-of-themes/">open discussion on the future of themes</a> that goes along with this proposal and whether themes should start taking advantage of experimental Gutenberg features.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 20:56:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>On November 28, millions of people awoke to a Black Friday ad on nearly every page of their WordPress admin, courtesy of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO plugin</a>.  That day also coincided with the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, so it left freelancers and agencies scrambling to address a banner on their clients&rsquo; sites on a day they likely planned to spend with family.  The ad was not limited to users with administrative permissions either, so some site owners were troubled to find users with low-level permissions could see the ad in the WordPress admin.</p>



<p>The initial code for the banner was <a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/commit/bf13569fa7a25aacac72e8b92c577adcafa9ccc6#diff-9ac66dbc3ac65e9898209f08c006799c">added on October 25</a>, which made its way into version 12.4 of the Yoast SEO plugin.  The code for the banner ad limited its output between November 28 and December 3 (Cyber Monday).</p>



<p>After blowback from users, the Yoast team published an updated version of the plugin without the banner.  However, the initial damage was done.  Users began immediately <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/reviews/?filter=1">leaving poor reviews</a> for the plugin.  The 1-star reviews are still coming in, putting the number over 100 in the span of five days.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That BlackFridayBanner was not the best idea,&rdquo; wrote Marieke van de Rakt, CEO of Yoast, <a href="https://twitter.com/MariekeRakt/status/1200077958700044290">on Twitter</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re truly sorry for the annoyance and difficulties it may have caused. We did not think this through properly. If you want, you can update to a new version of our plugin without that banner.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The initial decision to place the ad was about growth for Yoast&rsquo;s premium products.  The company has not grown as fast as expected over the past year explained van de Rakt.  They had also seen other plugins use those types of ads, which was a part of the decision to run it.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be clear,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;This was a mistake. We just didn&rsquo;t think this one through. It was incredibly stupid. So I can talk about why we made a decision, but I don&rsquo;t want that to be the explanation. The explanation is that we made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The ad was an animated banner, and some users complained that it was difficult to dismiss.  All notices in plugins available through the WordPress plugin directory must be dismissible.  &ldquo;That was a technical mistake,&rdquo; said van de Rakt of the issues with clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo; icon for dismissal.</p>



<p>While the team had seen other plugins run similar ads in the past, van de Rakt explained that they didn&rsquo;t take into account how large of a user base Yoast SEO has in comparison to those plugins.  &ldquo;For so many users, we were the first plugin that done this,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;They never saw this before in their backend. And they freak out. This was a complete error of judgment.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Yoast plans to talk more with its plugin&rsquo;s users.  Currently, the team is looking into creating a user-testing panel to prevent similar situations in the future.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In hindsight, and that&rsquo;s what I feel most bad about, the banner did not fit our values,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;These kinds of banners are not &lsquo;Yoast.&rsquo; Perhaps, if we state more explicitly what we as Yoast find important and what fits Yoast and what doesn&rsquo;t, a mistake like this will be made less quickly.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>Making Money with Freemium Products</h2>



<p>Yoast is a large company within the WordPress space.  It employs 90 people in its primary office in Wijchen, the Netherlands.  It also has an additional 20 employees around the world.  Running a successful business means paying everyone, contributing back to WordPress with its five-for-the-future work, and running charitable programs such as the Yoast Diversity Fund.</p>



<p>Currently, the Yoast SEO plugin has over 5 million active installs.  According to van de Rakt, only around 2% of the plugin&rsquo;s users also use the company&rsquo;s premium products.  Such a large plugin needs continuous funding to support and maintain.</p>



<p>Advertising a product or service in an internet culture that is seemingly averse to ads is not always easy.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather hard to find ways to reach our audience, and we also have some principles on how (not) to do that,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;We like to advertise in a straight-forward way. Tell people what they&rsquo;re buying. Ads are very annoying, but at least they are clear in what they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>One issue that plugin companies run into is the lack of an official premium marketplace for WordPress.  Currently, companies have to resort to in-admin advertising or similar tactics to push users on an upsell.  Most of Yoast&rsquo;s premium products are sold through banners on the plugin&rsquo;s pages in the WordPress admin.  Such practices do not always go over well with users, particularly when they are using a free product.  One wrong step and it could spell disaster for future growth.  Yoast is large enough to bounce back, but smaller companies may struggle more.</p>



<p>It is a tough balancing act between providing a valuable free product and making enough of a return to run a successful company.  The Yoast team does not want to lock their popular SEO plugin completely behind a paywall.  &ldquo;Our mission is SEO for everyone,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;We believe that every idea should have a fair chance in the search results. That means that also without any funds, people should be able to have a good working SEO plugin. Our free plugin is really important to us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I had a really bad weekend,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;I am a people pleaser and I was terribly sad by what happened. But, the discussion about how to handle this is a good one.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Perhaps some good will come of this incident if there is an open dialogue.  &ldquo;These kinds of things sometimes lead to different &lsquo;rule-sets&rsquo; or policies within WordPress,&rdquo; said van de Rakt.  &ldquo;Might even mean that there will be different and better ways for premium plugins to market their products.&rdquo;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 20:53:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

</div>



<p>This plugin’s goal is to make it easier to beta test our pre-releases. You just need to install and activate the plugin to be ready to try our beta and release candidate versions once we’ve announced them on this blog.​​<br />​<br />Beta testing BuddyPress is very important to make sure it behaves the right way for you and for the community. Although we, the BuddyPress Development Team, are regularly testing it, it’s very challenging to test every possible configuration of WordPress and BuddyPress. That’s why we absolutely need your help during these pre-release stages.​​</p>



<p>Making this plugin available was one of the means we thought about during our post 5.0.0 release development meeting to have more BuddyPress contributors.​​<br />​<br />Beta testing is actually a good way to start contributing, to anticipate and fix potential issues before you have the bad surprise to meet them once you&#8217;re upgrading to a new stable version of the plugin.​​</p>



<p><strong>NB:</strong> to beta test BuddyPress, we strongly advise you to have a local copy of your live site or a staging site : it’s always safer than doing it on a production site.​​</p>



<p>During our next pre-release stages, when you will find something is going wrong during your beta tests, please think of warning us about it submitting a ticket on our <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket">Development Tracker</a> or posting a new topic in our <a href="https://buddypress.org/support/">support forums</a>.​​</p>

Most notably, the navigation block is now a stable feature.  Theme authors can also start using block template parts and testing the post title and content blocks.</p>



<p>The update addressed several bugs with the block editor.  It also introduced new developer features such as the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17963">card component</a> and the ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17376">internationalize strings with safe HTML</a>.</p>



<p>Gradient classes are now <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18590">used for the cover block</a>.  Classes are a nicer solution than the inline styles used in earlier iterations.  Note that gradients are still an experimental feature.</p>



<p>For developers, there is a new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/docs/designers-developers/developers/backward-compatibility">backward-compatibility document</a> that outlines how the project preserves compatibility in its public APIs. This should be useful for all developers working on the project in the future.</p>



<h2>Navigation Block Now Stable</h2>



<img />Creating a nav menu with the navigation block.



<p>The navigation block is now a stable feature and no longer considered experimental.  The interface is much improved over earlier implementations.  For quickly building a menu of links, it does the job.  Users can manually type a link or search for an existing link for the site.</p>



<p>A user interface for nav menus in the block editor is no easy beast to tame.  The Gutenberg team managed to fit in the most common features without making it feel confusing.  For users, theme integration may be limited until their themes are updated with full support.  The default Gutenberg design may not be ideal or work at all in the context of the active theme.</p>



<p>The navigation block also comes with both light and dark block styles.  Theme authors can design these how they prefer, add additional styles, or remove the styles altogether.  More than likely, theme authors will begin adding several variations to their themes as a selling point in the long run.</p>



<p>The Gutenberg team dropped the background color option from the navigation block. Instead, users are encouraged to place it within a group block and add a background to the group. It is possible to change the link text color directly within the navigation block.</p>



<p>Currently, there is no parity between normal nav menu HTML classes and navigation block classes.  This could result in bulkier theme CSS, at least in the transition between how themes currently work and  the full site-editing era.  Inconsistent classes is an issue that should be handled with a <a href="https://wptavern.com/themes-of-the-future-a-design-framework-and-a-master-theme">design framework</a>.</p>



<h2>Post Title and Content Blocks Added</h2>



<img />Customized post title block output.



<p>As part of the experimental site-editing feature, Gutenberg has introduced the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18461">post title and post content blocks</a>.  These blocks act as placeholders and will output either the title or content.  Both blocks are foundational elements for true full-site editing.  Eventually, users will no longer be as limited to how their posts are output on the screen.</p>



<p>Currently, the post title block simply outputs the post title inside of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags. There are no classes for customizing the design. The other missing element at this point is the post byline or meta area that often accompanies the title.  In the long run, Gutenberg needs to have a method of handling post header and footer areas.</p>



<p>The custom post header feature has plagued theme authors for years, long before Gutenberg was around.  There are dozens or more implementations in the wild.  Some of them work with the block editor.  Others use custom post meta or the featured image.  However, users are often left with sub-par implementations that don&rsquo;t always work in the context of a specific post.</p>



<p>One of the features I have wanted to implement within Gutenberg is the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; image with text set over the top.  By using the built-in cover block and the post title block, I was able to accomplish this.  However, it was still missing the post byline.  Therefore, I put together a quick filter to output the post byline when the post title block is in use.</p>



<p><em>Any theme author who wants to test it out can modify the following code. I would not recommend this in production since this is an experimental feature, but it is good to start thinking ahead about possibilities.</em></p>


<pre class="brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate">
add_filter( 'pre_render_block', function( $block_content, $block ) {

    if ( 'core/post-title' === $block['blockName'] ) {

        $post = gutenberg_get_post_from_context();

        if ( ! $post ) {
            return $block_content;
        }

        if ( 'post' === $post-&gt;post_type ) {

            $block_content = '&lt;h1 class="entry__title"&gt;' . get_the_title( $post ) . '&lt;/h1&gt;';

            $block_content .= sprintf(
                '&lt;div class="entry__byline"&gt;%s &amp;middot; %s &amp;middot; %s&lt;/div&gt;',
                get_the_author(),
                get_the_date(),
                get_the_term_list( $post-&gt;ID, 'category' )
            );
        }
      }

    return $block_content;

}, 10, 2 );
</pre>


<h2>Block Template Parts for Themes</h2>



<p>Gutenberg 6.9 <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-6-9-introduces-image-titles-block-patterns-and-new-theme-features">introduced block templates</a> that resolve from a theme&rsquo;s <code>/block-templates</code> folder as part of the site-building experiment.  Version 7.0 takes that a step farther and introduces a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18339">block template parts system</a>, which resolves from a theme&rsquo;s <code>/block-template-parts</code> directory.</p>



<p>This new system allows top-level templates to house smaller, reusable template parts.  This is a rather standard method of template-part handling that has become a part of the normal theme-building experience.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see how this works in the long run.  WordPress&rsquo; current template part system for theme authors (i.e., <code>get_template_part()</code>) is a bare-bones implementation with little flexibility for handling features like hierarchy and passing data.  Thus far, the new feature seems to be a melding of blocks and old templating ideas, but it is too early in the process to see where it goes or whether theme authors will have to make customizations to bend the system to their will.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:22:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>On Giving Tuesday, December 3, WP&amp;UP is holding an online event called <a href="https://wpandup.org/go/dosummitgood">#DoSummitGood</a> that features speakers from various &ldquo;for good&rdquo; WordPress organizations.  The event will have nine sessions from 13 speakers.  It begins at <a href="http://www.timebie.com/std/utc.php?q=13">13:00 UTC</a>.</p>



<p>Giving Tuesday is a global movement meant to inspire generosity.  The celebration has run each year since 2012 on the Tuesday following the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.  The idea is to inspire people to do good, not for just one day of the year, but each day of their lives.</p>



<p>A WordPress-focused event on Giving Tuesday sounds like a perfect match.  Given the nature of open source and the charitable work of many of the people and companies in the space, it makes sense to hold a specific event for the holiday.   &ldquo;This is the first #DoSummitGood and there has already been a discussion about making this an annual event for Giving Tuesday,&rdquo; said Dan Maby, CEO and a Trustee of WP&amp;UP.</p>



<p>WP&amp;UP is a registered charity organization with a mission to support and promote positive mental health within the WordPress community.  Its <a href="https://wpandup.org/health-hubs/">Health Hubs</a> cover topics like business, skills, physical, and mental health.  The organization also provides support and counseling services.</p>



<p>The idea for the #DoSummitGood event was born from a WP&amp;UP <a href="https://wpandup.org/2019/10/join-our-open-discussion-town-hall-ama-on-wednesday-9th-october/">Town Hall</a> in October.  &ldquo;Our focus is on collaboration and our Town Halls are an opportunity for members of the public to get involved and help brainstorm ideas for the community, as well as get to know more about what WP&amp;UP does,&rdquo; said Maby.</p>



<p>The primary event will run via <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/dosummitgood/register">Crowdcast</a>.  By registering for the event, attendees will gain access to the Hallway Track to meet with other attendees online.  They will also have the ability to ask questions directly to the speakers.  Registration is free but will close once it reaches a specific number of signups.  &ldquo;WP&amp;UP is paying for the technical solution to deliver the event,&rdquo; said Maby.  &ldquo;As a registered charity we have to be responsible for expenditure, and so limiting the number of seats for this first event is one way we can do that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For those who do not register and attend via Crowdcast, they can still watch and participate in the event through various social platforms:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/WPandUP">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WPandUP/">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/wpandup">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wpandup">Twitch</a></li></ul>



<p>Each of the sessions will feature various international speakers who will give a talk on their area of expertise.  The sessions will follow a specific format and run for one hour.  For the first 10 minutes of each session, the individual speaker or group will talk about the &ldquo;for good&rdquo; entity they represent.  They will follow up with a 35-minute talk on their subject.  Afterward, the speaker and attendees will participate in an open Q&amp;A session.</p>



<p>The #DoSummitGood event is designed to give back.  &ldquo;Throughout the event, a donation form will be shared,&rdquo; said Maby.  &ldquo;All money raised through this form will be distributed between the various non-profits that feature in the event.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Cory Miller, a Trustee at WP&amp;UP, will kick off the event with a session titled &ldquo;The Iceberg of Life: How I Manage the Ups and Downs.&rdquo;  Miller has been open about mental health within the WordPress community and his struggles for several years.  He has previously written on the topic of <a href="https://corymiller.com/the-iceberg-of-life/">The Iceberg of Life</a>, which is worth reading if you are looking to get an early look into what his session may be about.</p>



<p>Marieke van de Rakt will follow up with a talk about improving a site&rsquo;s SEO.  She is representing Yoast and its <a href="https://wptavern.com/yoast-launches-fund-to-increase-speaker-diversity-at-tech-conferences">diversity fund program</a>, which helps to remove the financial burdens that cause minorities or underrepresented groups to speak at conferences.</p>



<p>The nine sessions have a diverse group of speakers from various organizations that are currently providing support for charities, minorities, and other groups that need help.  The topics include turning passion into a profession,  bringing more diversity to speaking roles at conferences, and more.  Two of the sessions will be round-table events with multiple speakers.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 19:26:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>&#8220;When you work in a distributed company, every time that you interact with your colleagues via text… you are taking out of your social bank account with them. So when you get people together, that’s when you have the opportunity to see each other face-to-face, and remind everybody that you’re all human beings. And fill that social capital back up because it’s so hard to communicate via text.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needed it as a talent hack, as a talent arbitrage.

<p>&#8220;I was going into an office but not seeing anyone or interacting with anyone except myself. So it almost was this zombie-like walk to the office every morning where I’m going to the office because I go to work, but I don’t see anyone who I work with. [laughs] And so I actually started waking up and just working on my computer at home. And then I said to myself, &#8216;Well, why am I even working from home?'&#8221;</p>

<p>“You can do things that are very commercial, but a little bit intellectually boring. And it tends to be the case that you’re doing a lot of rinse-and-repeat stuff if you want to grow purely commercially, so to speak. Or, you can do things that are wonderful intellectually, but the world doesn’t happen to value them and you can’t make commercial sense that way. And I’ve tried to navigate something in between those two where it’s where I’m really intellectually interested and where it’s commercially successful enough to sustain the process for a long time.”</p>

<p>“To work at a remote company demanded great communication skills, and everyone had them. It was one of the great initial delights. Every corporation has the same platitudes for the importance of clear communication, yet utterly fails to practice it. There was little jargon at Automattic. No ‘deprioritized action items’ or ‘catalyzing of crossfunctional objectives.’ People wrote plainly, without pretense and with great charm.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“A senior engineer makes the whole team better, but we don’t want to be prescriptive about how people made the team better. That was up to them.

You come in, you’re an experienced engineer, we expect you to be making the whole team better in some way, and what that looks like is up to you.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I started to feel like I was hitting a wall. This thing that I always dreamt of, to have a profitable company, to be financially secure, to have a team… I felt that having that success, having some of that financial security — it left me unfulfilled in a lot of other areas. — in the sense of deep lasting connection and also a lack of emotional resilience to deal with the ups and downs that startup life comes with.”</p>

<p>“We really want to encourage empathy in general. And so a key part of empathy is being able to try to see the other person’s point of view.

<p>If you are viewing WP Tavern from your browser today, you might be a bit shocked.  Things are different &mdash; much different.  If you are reading this post via email or a feed reader, hop on over to the live site to take a look.</p>



<p>Welcome to the new design!</p>



<p>When I accepted the job to write for WP Tavern, some of you asked if I would be handling anything with the design and development aspects of the site.  Today, you have your answer.  I was tasked with overhauling our dated design and getting something fresh up.</p>



<p>From the moment I logged in and started peeking behind the curtain, the task seemed almost insurmountable.  WP Tavern has had nearly 5,000 posts over 12 years.  It has content mixed and matched with plugins that have not been used in years.  Being perfectly honest, I was unsure what some plugins did for a long while.  However, I have gotten to know the site and its inner-workings over the past couple of months, and the new design has taken shape around some of that.</p>



<p>Rather than taking the time to do a complete overhaul of everything, which is sorely needed, our team decided the best course of action was to get a new theme up and iterate.</p>



<p>The first step of the design process was to remove the wood-grain background.  There is likely some nostalgia attached to that for some of our readers (some of you may have grown accustomed to it over the last 12 years), but it is the one thing we universally agreed to drop.</p>



<p>The second step was to move to a sidebar-less design.  Our team at the Tavern decided that nearly everything in the previous design&rsquo;s sidebar offered few benefits to our readers.  It was a distraction that took away from the content.</p>



<p>The next step of the design process was to add complete compatibility with the block editor (Gutenberg).  With no sidebar, this will open the door for us to do more interesting things with media and other elements over the long term.</p>



<p>Overall, the goal was to make the reading process nicer for all of you who visit the site.  I hope that we have accomplished that.</p>



<h2>The Future Design of the Site</h2>



<p>This is version 1.0 of the new design.  A large part of the process was laying the groundwork in a way that it would be easy to make changes going forward.</p>



<p>There are still some missing elements that will be re-added soon.  Primarily, the site needs a search form in the header/navigation area.  Redesigning the email subscription form and moving it to a different location is high on the list.</p>



<p>The site should load faster than before. However, there is still a lot of cleanup to do with plugins over the long haul. Page loads should be even snappier as we continue to iterate.</p>



<p>I also hope we can add a custom logo and other Tavern-<em>esque</em> elements that bring more personality to the site as we move along in this ongoing process.</p>



<p>However, this is the point where you, the WP Tavern audience, get to join the conversation.  Before pushing too far with additional changes, it is important to get your feedback about what you want to see in the coming days, weeks, and months.  Ultimately, the goal is to serve you WordPress news and information in the best way possible.</p>



<p>Feedback is certainly welcome.  If there is a missing element you want to see return, post it in the comments.  If there is something you would like to see added, don&rsquo;t be shy about letting us know.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wptavern.com/contact-me">contact form</a> is also always open for private feedback or for letting us know about a problem with the site.</p>



<h2>What Is Under the Hood?</h2>



<p>To get the theme up and running, I reused a ton of code from my previous theme-related work before joining WP Tavern. It made sense to use a build system I already knew from top to bottom and not reinvent the wheel.</p>



<p>The CSS system is a customized and stripped-down version of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>.  Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework.  For most of my professional career, I have shied away from utility-based frameworks.  However, Tailwind is a well-designed framework with a smart naming scheme that strikes a balance between readability and practicality.  It is one of the few that has clicked with me.  WordPress also uses several utility classes, especially with the block editor.  The two systems made sense together.</p>



<p>WordPress front-end output and some plugins (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Jetpack) do not make it easy to take a full utility-class approach.  Everything else was addressed on a case-by-case basis.</p>



<p>If any WordPress developers want to know more about the technical aspects, I am happy to answer questions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:32:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>It is a common saying among developers.  It makes sense.  Optimizing prematurely can mean redoing work down the line, and time is the developer&rsquo;s most finite resource.  It can mean spending that precious time optimizing for scenarios that do not yet exist for a product&rsquo;s users.  It can mean writing code that is harder to understand with unclear performance gains.</p>



<p>While participating with the WordPress theme review team about a year ago, I came across that nugget of advice once again.  <em>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</em>  The reply was to a theme author who was looking to decrease the number and weight of scripts their theme needed to load.  On one hand, the theme author could load a 1.29 kb script with no dependencies to get the job done.  The other option was to use the jQuery-dependent script included in core WordPress for a total of 105 kb because &ldquo;most&rdquo; WordPress sites are loading jQuery anyway.</p>



<p>For me, the answer was simple.  Use the smaller script unless the core script was already loaded on the front end.  I did not think of it in terms of <em>premature optimization</em>.  I thought of it as plain old, run-of-the-mill, everyday optimization.</p>



<p>Developers should not confuse <em>premature optimization</em> with the concept of making smart design decisions early in the process.  Nor should they wait until the final stage of development to start optimizing, a time when the focus is on getting a product out to end-users.  That is a sign of a poor product design process.</p>



<p>Over the past year, that conversation stuck with me.  It helped me become more cognizant of a terrifying trend, not just in the WordPress developer community, but with web development in general.  Far too often, developers are so far removed from normal users and the technology those users rely on that optimization is little more than an afterthought.  Instead, it should always be at the forefront of any developer&rsquo;s mind.</p>



<p>The overreliance on this misused quote has helped push the trend of measuring page weight in megabytes instead of kilobytes.  It is too often used as a catchall justification for not doing any optimization in the development phase while making up for it with file compression and caching in production.</p>



<p>Part of writing quality code is optimizing that code during every stage of the development process.  It is about making hard decisions to cut unnecessary things as the software comes together.  Caching should be a last resort after everything else has been cleaned up.</p>



<p>Premature optimization is more about attempting to optimize when there are no clear gains or working on micro-optimizations that alter the software&rsquo;s design for little-to-no benefit.  It does not mean overlooking obvious performance boosts during development.</p>



<h2>Not Everyone is on Gigabit Internet</h2>



<p>Most developers I know are on super-fast internet connections, often with 1 Gbps download speeds and unlimited data.  In that situation, it is easy to forget that large chunks of the world are still on slow connections with data caps.</p>



<p>Some may even associate slow connections with third-world countries where millions of people are on 2G cell phone technology.  However, there are large swaths of the United States and other developed countries that have no direct cable or DSL lines, which are commonly available in cities and suburbs.</p>



<p>This disconnect is directly evident when other developers have initiated chats with me.  In the past couple of years, it has been increasingly common for them to ask for a video chat.  It is not even questioned whether such a thing is possible (video chats are unreliable at best for me).  The ability to video chat at any time is taken for granted.</p>



<p>There are two internet service options in the area that I live in:  satellite or dial-up.  Even the local telephone company refuses to offer DSL in this area because of infrastructural costs with decades-old phone lines.  Because of the prohibitive costs of satellite internet access, which typically comes with data limits, many are stuck with dial-up.  Cell phone companies are changing the game to a degree, assuming service is reliable, but there are downfalls with going that route, which can include data or hotspot limitations.</p>



<p>For such a technologically-advanced country, many of its people are barely catching up to where others were a decade ago.</p>



<p>While I am fortunate enough to choose where I live and have nothing holding me back from moving, most do not have that option.  They are stuck with the best they can afford.  Even in rural areas, the internet is an inescapable part of daily life, and developers are not making it easy for these people.</p>



<p>While this is anecdotal, it is the stark reality of rural life in pockets of the US.</p>



<p>The upside of living in the backwoods of Alabama is that it has changed my perspective as a developer.  It has meant that I needed to question every code decision for every plugin and theme I built.  With data caps, I needed to make sure that I was not using too many resources.  </p>



<p>More than anything, having a data cap changed how I used the internet.  I now run an ad-blocker.  I have an extension to kill videos from auto-loading.  I disable JavaScript on heavy sites that I need to use.  Some sites seem interesting, but I never return to them because they are resource hogs.</p>



<p>When you live in a place where every byte matters, you tend to avoid wasting them.</p>



<p>While not always successful, since my transition to small-town life, I have attempted to build applications in a way that served people who are not privileged enough to have blazing-fast internet access.</p>



<p>Pointing this out is about making sure developers are aware that optimization matters.  It matters at every stage of the development process.  It matters because these people with slow connections and data caps also need to buy products, use services, read content, and do all the other things that people do on the web.</p>



<p>If you are a developer who is thinking about adding that slider, swiping mechanism for mobile, or some other slick gadget, think about those of who must wait for that feature to load.  Check that its dependencies are not loading too many extra resources.  Do some research to see if you can locate a lighter-weight implementation.  But, first, ask yourself if it is necessary.</p>



<p>The themes and plugins that WordPress developers build should never be the bottleneck for a website.  We can do better.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:31:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:11:"

<p><a href="https://wpagencysummit.com/">WP Agency Summit</a>, a virtual event for WordPress agencies, will kick off December 6, 2019, and last through December 16.  The event will feature daily sessions by over 30 WordPress professionals that are designed to help agencies grow their business.  Each session will be free to view, but there will be a price tag attached after the event closes.</p>



<p>Jan Koch, owner WP Mastery, is running the event.  WP Agency Summit is for profit, but Koch expressed a desire to give something back to the community that has helped him over the years.  &ldquo;I want this event to deliver value to the WP community, because I myself have received free support countless times from Facebook groups, forums, etc.,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the event is free to watch online while it&rsquo;s running.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The event is primarily aimed at WordPress agencies, but others may find value in it.  &ldquo;This event is also interesting for WordPress freelancers and digital agencies who occasionally use WordPress,&rdquo; said Koch.  &ldquo;However, being a WordPress agency owner myself, I wanted to ensure that business owners like myself and those in similar situations get the most value from the event.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Video sessions will be available to view for 48 hours at no cost.  For those who sign up for a free pass, they can upgrade to lifetime access for $127. That lifetime access will go up to $197 during the event and $497 afterward.</p>



<p>Potential buyers may want to opt for the free option before deciding whether future access to the sessions and bonus materials are worth plunking down the cash.  For an agency, the cost is minimal either way.  However, for a solo freelancer, the $497 price is high enough to warrant caution.  Most will want to check out the material first.</p>



<p>Each of the video sessions is prerecorded and edited rather than shot live.  Koch is using Vimeo Pro to host the videos.  There will be a live hangout to begin the event.  Attendees and speakers will also get a Facebook group invite for asking questions and engaging with each other.</p>



<p>Cloudways, Siteground, and MainWP are sponsoring the event, which helps cover some of the up-front costs.  Outside of that, Koch is handling the remainder of those costs out of his pocket but is hopeful for a positive return through the sale of lifetime access to the materials.</p>



<p>Koch first ran a virtual summit called &ldquo;The WP Summit&rdquo; in 2015, which was a more broad event based on various WordPress topics.  That event had over 2,000 registrations.  &ldquo;As you can imagine, just talking about topics related to WP resulted in a very wide-spread speaker lineup, so there weren&rsquo;t any clear takeaways,&rdquo; said Koch.</p>



<p>The idea for WP Agency Summit has been in Koch&rsquo;s mind since 2018.  It wasn&rsquo;t until some conversations with others at WordCamp Europe (WCEU) in 2019 that it started coming together.  &ldquo;After WCEU, I invested in a virtual training for summits and hired a mentor to properly set up the WP Agency Summit,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;My goal is to run 4 events like this in 2020, so this summit is serving as &lsquo;crash test dummy&rsquo; and foundation at the same time.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>The Speaker Lineup</h2>



<p>There are over 30 speakers signed on for the event.  Kim Doyal, a content marketer formerly known as &ldquo;The WordPress Chick,&rdquo; will teach agencies how to write copy that attracts higher-paying clients.  Ahmad Awais, core WordPress contributor, will teach how to save time writing code in the VS Code editor.</p>



<p>Most sessions will focus on how agencies can grow their business with topics related to recurring revenue, marketing, and working with clients.  Each day of the event will feature three or four sessions.</p>



<p>WP Agency Summit is hosting a diverse male lineup of over 20 speakers from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the US.  However, there are only four sessions lead by women within the industry.  &ldquo;I recognize this as a problem with my event,&rdquo; said Koch.  &ldquo;The reason I have so much more male than female speakers is quite simple, the current speaker line-up is purely based on connections I had when I started planning for the event. It was a relatively short amount of time for me, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to build relationships with more female WP experts beforehand.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Koch assures that he will have a more balanced ratio for upcoming summits in 2020 and beyond.  &ldquo;Even in this prelaunch phase, I already got in touch with many outstanding women in the WP community which would make perfect speakers for the next events,&rdquo; he said.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:50:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>I purchased my first computer set when I was 19 years old, but several years before that, at the age of 15, I took a computer and MS-DOS training course and without having a computer, by merely practicing on paper, I managed to get the perfect score on the final exam.</p>
<p>It was during those years that internet gradually entered our town. Well, don’t be shocked. Internet was introduced to our small town pretty late and we got acquainted with this technological phenomenon very late. However, internet instantly found its place in my daily routine and I was fascinated by it.  After surfing the internet for a year, I was little by little encouraged to find out what a website is and how it works. Thus, I familiarized myself with the first programming language, that is, HTML and began learning it and given my enthusiasm, I mastered it in less than 10 days.</p>
<p>I was increasingly attracted to the internet and the issues pertinent to it, and soon enough I was drawn to various internet technologies. In less than a year, I was able to learn PHP, CSS, and HTML and relying on my limited knowledge, I began testing different systems and scripts.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Blogging</h3>
<p>During those same years, I worked with various blog systems, one of which was B2 system. A little while later, while conducting tests, doing installations, and having fun, I encountered a system which was quite similar to B2. I installed it. Then, I entered its various parts.  I found its management system, templates and codes quite appealing and easy to work with. Thus, I began translating it into Persian for my personal purposes, and in less than a week, I turned most of its various parts into Persian and they were ready to be used. Yet, due to certain reasons, I failed to install this system on my host or test it online. But I kept the system on my computer and I worked with it and enjoyed it. Yes, that system was one of the first versions of WordPress.</p>
<p>Prior to working with WordPress, I had worked with various systems and scripts, and I was primarily accustomed to Joomla. However, simplicity, convenience, and interesting environment of WordPress drew me towards this system and I kept working with it.</p>
<p>I was by nature shy and reticent; therefore, I was not that active in any groups or forums –this was the case in my personal life as well as on the web. Consequently, during the first few years of my activity in the field of WordPress, I hardly ever participated in WordPress forums or local groups.</p>
<h3>Getting Involved</h3>
<p>However, one of my friends who was active in the field of Persian WordPress, invited me to collaborate with one of the Persian WordPress support forums and this was a new beginning for me in the area of localization of WordPress.</p>
<p>My keen interest in working with WordPress as well as helping others work and become more familiar with it made me spend a lot of time daily in the Persian WordPress forum. Nevertheless, due to the shortcomings and needs of the Persian WordPress community, we also created another support website. Following the creation of this new website, many users were attracted to it and gradually we got a lot of feedback from the Persian WordPress community. So, we became further involved with the Persian WordPress community and the scope of our activities expanded.</p>
<p>It was during these years that I got my first formal job offer in the field of WordPress and I launched the first WordPress website for a client and received money in return for my services.  This experience highly motivated me and helped me envision my future as a WordPress developer. Meanwhile, with the help of some of my friends, I started a small web design and development company which was supposed to focus on coding and programming electronic components, but my keen enthusiasm for web development drew the entire team to focus on web design and development. Due to my numerous activities in the field of WordPress and my growing recognition as a WordPress activist, over the course of a few years, virtually all of our company activities centered on WordPress as the main basis of our work, and now we are one of the active supporters of WordPress in Iran.</p>
<h3>Transformations</h3>
<p>Over the years, WordPress transformed my personal and professional life. My personal life was changed in the respect that from a shy, quiet and inactive guy, I turned into an energetic, active person interested in discussions and participation in social events. Along the way, I also met great and influential people, including my future spouse.</p>
<p>We organized various gatherings and meetups in the field of WordPress. We held WordPress seminars. We set up various public forums and groups to enhance the impact of WordPress and educate newcomers, and thus, many changes occurred in my overall mood and personality.</p>
<p>Besides, prior to the general change of direction in our company towards web and especially WordPress, our revenues were low and the company had a very slow growth; yet following our change of direction and basing the structure of the company on WordPress, our annual growth rate increased dramatically and there was a considerable increase in the size of the company, number of the personnel, and payments.</p>
<p>I should also mention that I am a graduate of textile engineering. However, my field of study has nothing to do with my career interests. Since from a very young age I dreamt of working in the field of computer science, even studying an irrelevant major did not stop me from pursuing my old dream and while studying textile engineering, I worked in the field of computer science and in my own company.</p>
<p>Now, 16 years after my first encounter with WordPress, it has pervaded every aspect of my life and has changed me personally, mentally, and professionally and has influenced my choice of career and business. And I am really glad that on that day I became familiar with WordPress and started working with it and am still involved with it up to this day, because not only my life changed as a result, but also I managed to educate so many people and help them transform their lives in a way that WordPress played a major role in their lives and contributed to their further success.</p>
<h1 id="fas">ساختن یک زندگی وردپرسی در ایران</h1>
<p>من اولین کامپیوتر خود را وقتی ۱۹ ساله بودم خریدم ولی چندین سال قبل از آن  در سن 15 سالگی به کلاس آموزش کامپیوتر و دوره آموزشی کار با DOS رفتم  و بدون داشتن کامپیوتر و با تمرین روی کاغذ توانستم نمره کامل رو در آزمون نهایی کسب کنم.</p>
<p>در همان سالها بود که اینترنت کم کم وارد شهر ما شد، بله تعجب نکنید درشهرکوچک ما اینترنت خیلی دیر وارد شد و ما خیلی دیر با این پدیده آشنا شدیم اما اینترنت به سرعت جای خود را در کارهای روزمره من باز کرد و من شیفته آن شدم بعد از یک سال کار کردن با اینترنت من کم کم ترغیب شدم که بفهمم سایت چیست و چگونه کار میکند و با اولین زبان یعنی HTML آشنا شدم و شروع به یادگیری آن کردم و با اشتیاق فراوانی که داشتم آن را در کمتر از ۱۰ روز یاد گرفتم.</p>
<p>من هر روز بیشتر جذب اینترنت و موضوعات مرتبط با آن می شدم و به سرعت به سوی تکنولوژی های مختلف اینترنتی کشیده شدم. یک سال هم طول نکشید که توانستم HTML / CSS / PHP را یاد بگیرم و با همون دانش اندک، شروع به تست سیستم و اسکریپتهای مختلف کردم.</p>
<h3>مقدمه‌ای برای شروع</h3>
<p>در همان سال‌ها من با سیستم‌های وبلاگی مختلفی کار کردم که یکی از آن‌ها سیستم b2 بود. کمی بعدتر در همین تستها و نصب‌ها و بازیگوشی ها  با سیستمی مواجه شدم که بسیار شبیه b2 بود. آن را نصب کردم سپس وارد بخش‌های مختلف آن شدم، سیستم مدیریت، بخش قالب و کدهای آن و بسیار برایم ساده و جالب و جذاب به نظر رسید و به همین دلیل شروع به فارسی کردن آن برای کارهای شخصی خود کردم و کمتر از یک هفته بخش‌های مختلف آن را تا حدود زیادی فارسی و آماده استفاده کرده بودم. اما به دلایل خاصی موفق نشدم که آن را بر روی هاست خود نصب و به صورت آنلاین تست کنم. ولی آن سیستم را بر روی کامپیوتر خود نگه داشتم و با آن کار می کردم و لذت می بردم. بله آن سیستم یکی از اولین نسخه های وردپرس بود.</p>
<p>من قبل از کار با وردپرس با سیستم ها و اسکریپت های مختلفی کار کرده بودم و بیشترین اسکریپتی که با آن انس گرفته بودم جوملا بود اما سادگی و روانی و محیط جذاب مدیریت وردپرس باعث شد که من به سمت وردپرس کشیده شوم و کار با آن را ادامه دهم.</p>
<p>من ذاتا آدم کم حرف و خجالتی بودم و به همین دلیل خیلی در گروه ها و انجمن های خاصی فعالیت نمی‌کردم و این هم شامل وب و هم شامل زندگی عادی من میشد به همین دلیل تا چند سال اولیه فعالیت من در وردپرس، خیلی در انجمنهای تخصصی و یا گروه های محلی آن  فعالیتی نداشتم.</p>
<h3>شروع مشارکت</h3>
<p>تا اینکه یکی از دوستان من که از فعالان وردپرس در زبان فارسی بود من را دعوت به همکاری در یکی از انجمن های پشتیبانی وردپرس به زبان فارسی کرد و این شروعی دوباره برای من در زمینه محلی سازی وردپرس بود.</p>
<p>علاقه زیاد من به کار با وردپرس و همچنین کمک به دیگران برای کار و آشنایی بیشتر با وردپرس باعث شد که من روزانه زمان زیادی را در انجمن وردپرس فارسی صرف کنم. اما با توجه به کمبود ها و نیازهایی که جامعه فارسی داشت ما یک سایت پشتیبانی دیگر را نیز ایجاد کردیم با ایجاد سایت جدید کاربران زیادی جذب ما شدند و کم کم ما بازخوردهای زیادی را از جامعه فارسی گرفتیم به همین دلیل بیشتر درگیر جامعه فارسی وردپرس شدیم و دامنه فعالیت های ما نیز گسترش پیدا کرد.</p>
<h3>دگرگونی</h3>
<p>در همین سال‌ها اولین پیشنهاد کاری رسمی من در زمینه وردپرس رسید و من اولین سایت خود را برای یک مشتری با وردپرس برپا کردم و در قبال آن مبلغی را دریافت کردم که این موضوع باعث شد انگیزه زیادی در من شکل بگیرد و مسیر حرکتی آینده خود را در وردپرس ببینم. همزمان، با کمک چند نفر از دوستان خود یک شرکت طراحی و برنامه نویسی کوچک را تاسیس کردیم که روند آن قرار بود بر کدنویسی و برنامه نویسی برای قطعات الکترونیکی باشد اما اشتیاق فراوان من به طراحی وب باعث شد که نظر کلیه جمع نیز به سمت کدنویسی و طراحی وب کشیده شود. با توجه به فعالیت‌های زیاد من در وردپرس و بیشتر شناخته شدن من به عنوان یک فعال وردپرسی، در طی یک بازه زمانی چند ساله، کلیه فعالیت های شرکت ما نیز به سمت وردپرس کشیده شد و مبنای اصلی کارهای ما وردپرس شد و هم اکنون ما یکی از حامیان فعال وردپرس در ایران هستیم.</p>
<p>طی سالیان مختلف وردپرس زندگی شخصی و کاری من را تغییر داد. زندگی شخصی من را از این جهت تغییر داد که از یک آدم خجالتی و کم حرف و کم فعالیت به یک آدم فعال، پر انرژی و علاقمند به بحث و گفتگو و حضور در اجتماعات تبدیل شوم. در این مسیر با افراد بزرگ و تاثیرگذار منجمله با همسر آینده خود نیز آشنا شدم.</p>
<p>اجتماعات و میتاپهای مختلفی را در زمینه وردپرس راه اندازی نمودیم. سمینار های وردپرسی برگزار کردیم. انجمن ها و گروه‌های مردمی مختلفی را در جهت افزایش نفوذ وردپرس و آموزش آن به افراد تازه کار راه اندازی کردیم و به همین دلیل تغییرات زیادی در روحیه و خلقیات و شخصیت کلی من ایجاد شد.</p>
<p>همچنین تا قبل از تغییر روند کلی شرکت ما به سمت وب و علی‌الخصوص وردپرس، شرکت درآمد خاصی نداشت و بسیار کند رشد می کرد اما پس از تغییر رویه و راه اندازی بستر اصلی شرکت بر روی وردپرس روند سالانه ما به شدت رشد کرد و هم از نظر اندازه و هم تعداد کارکنان و هم از نظر سطح دستمزد و حقوق پیشرفت چشمگیری در شرکت ایجاد شد.</p>
<p>این را هم اضافه کنم که من فارغ التحصیل در رشته مهندی نساجی هستم. اما رشته تحصیلی من با رشته و علاقمندی کا ی من کاملا از هم جدا و نامرتبط هستند. چون من از جوانی آرزو و شوق کار کردن در زمینه کامپیوتر را داشتم و حتی تحصیل در رشته ای نامرتبط هم سبب نشد که دست از آرزوی قدیمی خود بردارم  و حتی همزمان با تحصیل در رشته نساجی، در زمینه کامپیوتر و در شرکت خود مشغول به کار بودم.</p>
<p>حالا ۱۶ سال از اولین برخورد و کار من با وردپرس می‌گذرد و وردپرس تقریباً در همه زمینه های مختلف زندگی من نفوذ کرده و باعث تغییر من در زمینه شخصی، روحی و کاری و کسب و کار  من شده است و از این بابت بسیار خوشحال هستم که آن روز توانستم با وردپرس آشنا شده و شروع به کار کنم و تا به امروز نیز درگیر آن باشم.</p>
<p>زیرا علاوه بر اینکه زندگی من تغییر کرد، توانستم افراد زیادی را نیز آموزش داده و به آنها کمک کنم تا زندگی‌ آنها نیز تغییر کند و وردپرس شاکله زندگی آنها را تشکیل داده و باعث موفقیت بیشتر آنها شود.</p>

The first Action allows developers to deploy plugin updates directly to the WordPress.org plugin directory by tagging a release on GitHub.  The second Action handles readme file and asset updates. </p>



<p>On November 14, GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/2019-11-14-powering-community-led-innovation-with-github-actions/">announced the public launch</a> of their GitHub Actions feature.  GitHub Actions are a way for developers to automate workflows from their Git repositories.  Actions can also be shared with others, reused across projects, and forked like any other public repository.</p>



<p>Currently, there are over 1,300 GitHub Actions with more being added every day.  At least <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=actions&query=wordpress">nine of the current Actions</a> are related to WordPress, including an Action to <a href="https://wptavern.com/rtcamp-releases-github-actions-for-automated-code-review-deploying-wordpress-and-slack-notifications">deploy WordPress by rtCamp</a>, but there will certainly be more to come in the future.</p>



<p>With GitHub Actions out of beta, it opens the door for companies like 10up to share their custom workflows and for others to build upon them.  It will also be interesting to see what Actions other developers within the WordPress ecosystem release.</p>



<p>The 10up team initially <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/introducing-github-actions-for-wordpress-plugins/">launched their custom Actions</a> for WordPress in March 2019, which was during GitHub Actions beta period.  &ldquo;Everybody has been very positive,&rdquo; said Helen Hou-Sand&iacute;, director of open source initiatives at 10up and WordPress lead developer.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a number of people report bugs, request enhancements, and contribute code and documentation. That&rsquo;s been a really great measure of adoption and attention for me &mdash; having people give thoughtful critical feedback and help us improve this tool for everybody.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Hou-Sand&iacute; is interested in seeing other ideas for adding workflows or potentially new Actions from the community.  &ldquo;An example of something we&rsquo;ve just started doing without writing a whole new Action is generating hook documentation and deploying that to GitHub Pages, which eliminates the need to generate locally, commit manually, and decide on where to host things,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Development was actually smoother than I anticipated,&rdquo; said Hou-Sand&iacute; of creating and testing the team&rsquo;s GitHub Actions.  &ldquo;Maybe because I spent a fairly long time planning and obsessing over potential issues and chose to use Bash.&rdquo;  For testing, she was able to use an inactive plugin repo on WordPress.org.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I could have come up with a method to test completely locally, but being able to use actual environments without repercussions was helpful.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The 10up team has already been deploying plugin updates with the Actions.  Hou-Sand&iacute; said that she does not think about this in terms of saving time, even though the team is already tagging releases via GitHub.  </p>



<p>&ldquo;What it&rsquo;s really done for us is, along with well-documented release processes, made it so that anybody can jump in and get a plugin updated or released without worrying about modifying commit permissions or their personal knowledge of SVN,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;This makes it much easier to get releases out especially when it&rsquo;s an urgent bugfix.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>Deploying and Updating WordPress Plugins</h2>



<p>Both of the GitHub Actions created by 10up help ease the pain of deploying plugin updates to the official WordPress plugin directory.  They are designed to streamline plugin release management and simplify the process of getting code out to end-users.</p>



<p>WordPress plugin authors must use Subversion (SVN) to commit and tag plugin releases in the directory.  Often, this is an issue because Git is the most-used version control system.  Some developers have no experience with SVN, and the number of developers unfamiliar with it will likely only grow as Git continues to gain popularity.  Even with those who do understand SVN, switching between version control systems can hinder workflows, particularly with larger teams.</p>



<p>With so many WordPress plugin developers using Git, it makes sense to use tools that are a part of their daily workflow rather than jumping into a system only used during releases.  That is where both of these GitHub Actions developed by 10up can help.  </p>



<p>Adding Actions to a repository is a fairly straightforward process.  All repositories have a new &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; tab.  Developers can create new workflows directly from the Actions page for their repository.  When adding a new workflow, it is simply a matter of copying and pasting a particular Action&rsquo;s code snippet.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img />Adding a custom GitHub workflow.</div>



<p>The <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wordpress-plugin-deploy">WordPress Plugin Deploy</a> Action is for deploying plugin updates directly to the WordPress plugin directory.  When developers tag a release on GitHub, it will automatically commit the update to the WordPress.org SVN repository.  The Action respects <code>.distignore</code> and <code>.gitattributes</code> for ignoring files that should not be distributed to users.  It also allows developers to add their plugin assets to a <code>.wordpress-org</code> folder, which will be committed to the top-level <code>assets</code> directory.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wordpress-plugin-readme-assets-update">WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update</a> is a separate Action that allows developers to commit changes to their plugin&rsquo;s readme or assets.  It is useful when plugin authors need to update their plugin&rsquo;s <code>Tested up to</code> version number or update screenshots, banners, and icons.  This Action watches for changes on a specified branch.</p>



<p>Both Actions require developers to set up secret values for their WordPress SVN username and password.  Secrets are encrypted data that can be set via a repository&rsquo;s &ldquo;Settings &gt; Secrets&rdquo; screen.  The SVN username and password are required so that GitHub can deploy commits to WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 23:00:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Users can now add custom image title attributes.  Plugin developers can start diving into the new Block Patterns API.  Plus, theme authors can begin tinkering with the experimental gradient presets and block templates features.</p>



<p>Gutenberg 6.9 fixed numerous bugs, including an annoying <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16429">invalid content error</a> when selecting a color for the pullquote block.  The update included several enhancements and changes to the underlying codebase.</p>



<p>Much of the work in version 6.9 went toward experimental features, including the navigation block.  At this point, the nav block still needs a ton of work for practical use.  The interface is still a bit clunky.  Undoubtedly, this is one of the toughest user experience challenges to solve and will take time before it is ready for widespread usage.  Right now, it is about continually iterating upon the work from previous versions.</p>



<h2>Image Title Attribute Field</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img />Editing the image title field in Gutenberg.</div>



<p>The ability to add image titles is perhaps the biggest user-facing feature added in Gutenberg 6.9.  The <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/11054">original ticket</a> for adding the feature has been simmering for over a year.</p>



<p>The Gutenberg team added the title field under the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab when editing an image block. This was a smart decision because image titles are often used incorrectly to describe an image, which is the job of the &ldquo;Alt Text&rdquo; field located under the &ldquo;Image Settings&rdquo; tab.  Image titles are also generally unnecessary.  When used, they should describe the role of the image on the page.</p>



<h2>Initial Block Patterns API Merged</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img />Choosing a column layout in the block editor.</div>



<p>The Block Patterns API is a developer feature primarily for creating initial setup states for complex blocks.  For example, the columns block has several common patterns that users may want to choose. By providing those patterns when first inserting a block, the user does not have to go through the routine of configuring all of the settings for it.</p>



<p>The idea is to cut back on the complexities of configuring some blocks so that users can more quickly get to the point of adding their custom content and getting their desired results.</p>



<p>The first step toward the Block Patterns API was <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18270">merged into Gutenberg 6.9</a>, but it is still in the experimental stage at this point.</p>



<h2>Block Gradient Presets</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img />Adding a gradient background to a button in Gutenberg.</div>



<p>Gutenberg introduced gradient backgrounds in <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-6-7-introduces-storybook-and-gradient-backgrounds">version 6.7</a> for the button block. The feature launched with a set of gradients that did not match users&rsquo; themes, which meant the feature was little more than a fun experiment.</p>



<p>In version 6.9, developers can register custom gradients that are less of an eyesore by using colors that fit into the theme&rsquo;s color palette.</p>



<p>Currently, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-gradient-presets">block gradient presets</a> are marked as an experimental feature and use the <code>__experimental-editor-gradient-presets</code> theme support flag.  Now is a good time for theme authors to begin exploring this feature so they can be ready when the experimental flag is removed.</p>



<h2>Block Templates for Themes</h2>



<p>For theme authors, block templates were the most exciting aspect of Gutenberg&rsquo;s potential when it first launched.  Throughout all of WordPress&rsquo; history, creating custom page templates, particularly front page templates, has been an exercise in frustration.  Theme authors have always had great ideas about what their themes&rsquo; front pages should look like.  In a way, it is an author&rsquo;s signature on a theme project.  It is often what sets one theme apart from another.</p>



<p>However, creating an interface that allows users to change what is traditionally a blog post list to something more ornate and complex is not an easy thing to do.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of varying implementations are currently in the wild, each with their take on how to create a custom front page.</p>



<p>Enter Gutenberg.  Theme authors, regardless of whether they love or hate it, usually see the potential of a block-based editor in terms of laying out a front page.  The idea of having complete control over where specific blocks sit and how they appear on the front end is an alluring one, especially if there is a standardized experience for users to figure out how to plug their content into the blocks.</p>



<p>Gutenberg 6.9 <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18247">laid the groundwork</a> toward this reality by resolving block templates from a theme&rsquo;s <code>/block-templates</code> folder.</p>



<p>At this point, theme block templates are still in the experimental stage as part of the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/17512">full site editing feature</a>.  From a theme development perspective, this could be revolutionary.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 19:03:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Scott has long used JavaScript as a core technology with AppPresser. I think he's on the forefront of thinking about and using technologies that are new to WordPress but out in full force in other ecosystems. </p>



<p>Scott is really into <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> (JavaScript, APIs, Markup). He's working on <a href="https://staticfuse.com/">Static Fuse</a> now, which helps connect WordPress to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. Gatsby has a <em>lot</em> of attention in web tech right now.</p>



<p>We also dig pretty deeply into the challenges and opportunities facing independent developers, and the interest levels in WordPress from the indie dev crowd. It's an interesting episode, and I learned a lot from Scott. I hope you do too. Enjoy our conversation!</p>
